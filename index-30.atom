    <title>Mayoral Control - only when your guy's the mayor</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orga371de7" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orga371de7"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga371de7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The hot debate this past week in NY Education circles is Mayoral
Control. When I started teaching, New York City schools were
controlled by the Board of Education. The board appointed a
chancellor. The system was supposed to balance community control as
well as some centralized decision making. The system was created in
the late 60s and was entrenched through my schooling. By the time I
was a teacher I think it was pretty much a given that the system
didn't work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In 2002, everything changed with Mayoral control under Michael
Bloomberg. Under mayoral control, the mayor appoints the chancellor
who appoints superintendents an on down the line. This was supposed to
create a chain of accountability leading up to and including the
mayor. To address concerns that parents voices would be heard, we had
the Panel for Educational Policy or PEP which was supposed to vet and
vote on policy and initiatives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sounds good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, it was all a farce. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Parents may or may not have had a voice under the old system but they
certainly didn't have a voice with mayoral control. The majority of
members of the panel were mayoral appointees and if they didn't vote
100% in line with their masters wishes, they were removed for someone
who would. Schools were closed and initiatives were passed that were
wildly unpopular with parents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What did we get under mayoral control? There was some good, but we
also got: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% buy in to the pet education theories of non-educators like Bill
gates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School leaders who barely taught and had little experience as
educators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destruction of neighborhood schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destruction of just about all of the large comprehensive high schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open doors for private charter schools that follow questionable
practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flawed (at best)  school and teacher evaluation models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ATR pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, reformers - those out to privatize education loved mayoral
control under Bloomberg. It destabilized teaching as a career
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Did results improve?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some would say yes but it's debatable. Graduation rates and test
scores are controlled by the politicians. When you have tests made,
graded, and curved in secret (except for those charter schools that
are exempt or grade their own tests), you've got to question any gains
or losses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bloomberg's failing was (and possibly still is) that he and his
appointees didn't understand education or teachers. Education not a
business and can't be treated the same way.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Did this help with accountability? To quote Mr. Bloomberg: "They can
boo me at parades." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fast forward to the de Blasio administration. Personally, I was not a
fan of Bloomberg's educational policy and I also feel that de Blasio's
also doing a poor job. Regardless of my opinion, Mayoral control under
de Blasio has certainly felt more community friendly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This hasn't sat well with the reformers upstate and while Michael
Bloomberg was granted mayoral control for his entire term, Bill de
Blasio has had to fight for it every year and every year control has
come with strings attached – generally involving the flow of money
into private charter schools - still with questionable practices and
results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The funny thing is that many of those saying mayoral control was bad
during the Bloomberg era say it's a necessity now  and many against it
under Bloomberg are fans under de Blasio.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's even funnier, in a tragic way is that it isn't really even
control. So much is really controlled in Albany under Governor
Cuomo. When de Blasio wanted to charge private charters for space
(rightfully so, in my opinion), Albany stepped in and gave the
charters a free pass. How is that mayoral control?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of your political leanings, it's pretty clear that mayoral
control is only a good thing when the mayor is your guy. We need
something brand new that supports our communities. I was at the
&lt;a href="https://personaldemocracy.com/conference"&gt;Personal Democracy Forum 2017&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and a recurring
theme, one which we really need now for our schools is:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;build with, not for&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If we don't get there we'll be stuck booing our politicians at parades.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Are best practices always the best?</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/best-practices-cli/</id>
    <updated>2017-06-21T16:30:35-04:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orgd74068d" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgd74068d"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd74068d"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I've been trying to be an active participant on the &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educators
StackExchange&lt;/a&gt;. You should try to as well!!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I answered a question about using the command line which led to a back
and forth. I gave an example of something I might do in class to
illustrate the power of using the command line and linked to some of
my past &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/cli/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;. There was some back and forth in the comments - some of
the participants weren't happy with my code as they felt it was filled
with poor coding practices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm not going to comment on the discussion other than to say that I
make no apologies for how I use the Linux tools and the command line
as my methods have served me well over the years. I also make no
apologies on how I teach my students as I seem to have by and large
done right by them over the years as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The crux was that I was showing what I might type in a class without
any of the class commentary. It wasn't meant to be a script in a file
let alone reusable code or a full blown program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't want to spend time here talking about "best practices" for
shell scripting. There are plenty of &lt;a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; a search engine away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question is that how universal are best practices and is it more
important that we teach specific best practices or rather that we have
a discussion with our students about best practices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some general best practices are probably pretty universal – "write
clear code" but I've seen best practices that when followed
religiously just don't always make sense:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;never break out of a loop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;one return statement per function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always or never do anything in particular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all code should be commented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always use an ORM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
to list a few.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, best practices aren't always best. More like guidelines to think
about when you're programming and then you and your team can make
smart decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, when I wrote those lines over on StackExchange, was I really
showing my students how to code badly? The code:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ls *gif | while read i 
do
  f=`basename $i .gif`
  convert $i -resize 200x200 smaller-$f.gif
done
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
doesn't exist in a vacuum. We start with an ls to see the directory,
we use the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;echo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; throughout to test things before we run it live
and then we run it live in such a way that it can't be
destructive. I've been using the command line this way for decades and
while I've screwed plenty of things up, it's never been due to a bad
command line shell practice. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The important part is the discussion with the class:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;would this be appropriate in a script file?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the dangers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why and when is it ok?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
etc.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's not our job to dictate to our students which best practices to
follow but rather to prepare them to make smart decisions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year, I'm back to using C++ in class after maybe two decades. I'm
not up on current C++ best practices. I was wondering what was best:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"something"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;endl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"something"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stdendl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;cout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"something"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;endl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
or even if we should use "\n" vs endl.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I did my research, presented the results to my students and we talked
about what they should consider when making their decision.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Students don't need us to blindly 
spout best practices. They can read them online or in a book. They do
need us to guide them towards critically thinking about them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-org0b90f85" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org0b90f85"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b90f85"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I stumbled across a video by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timbaldridge?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Tim Baldridge&lt;/a&gt; this morning. I don't know
Tim - it looks like he's a developer and he's made a number of
instructional videos on Clojure. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This video is titled "Learning a Language Takes time." 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the video (embedded below) Tim talks about the design of a guitar
and a violin. How a guitar is "better" designed - frets make it easy
to hit correct notes, tuning pegs stay in place and you can easily
play a single note or a chord.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Contrast that to a violin. Tuning pegs have no mechanism and are held
in place by friction, notes must be precisely hit, and producing even
a single note at a time so that it sounds good is a challenge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, you can do some really amazing things on a violin
if you master it. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This struck a chord with me. I once saw an interview with Itzhak
Perlman - my favorite violinist or all time (and coincidentally my
childhood violin teacher' teacher). He was comparing a violinist with
a pianist. He said that it was easy to play the correct notes in tune
on a piano and since the mechanics were simpler a musician can,
earlier in their career, start working on interpreting the music. A
violinist, on the other hand (in his opinion) can take half a lifetime
to master just from the mechanics point of view and only then can you
really start working on the music.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perlman was talking about an album he had released - "&lt;a href="https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/itzhak-perlman-concertos-from-my-childhood"&gt;Concertos from
my Childhood&lt;/a&gt;." The idea was that young violinists study a standard
repertoire of "learning concertos" and of course, since they're
beginners they never sound good. Perlman decided to record a number of
these as an adult and this album was the result.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's a track of Perlman playing one of those concertos that I
remember struggling through as a kid:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggMPSbSyynY?list=RDHKo93tLga6w"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggMPSbSyynY?list=RDHKo93tLga6w&lt;/a&gt;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, this is Perlman so I'm betting he sounded pretty good as a
kid:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4eLoWm9swbM"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4eLoWm9swbM&lt;/a&gt;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Back to Tim's video. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tim talks about the idea that learning a language, much like an
instrument takes time and also that some languages do less hand
holding and are harder to learn than others. The two key points are:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some times things are harder to learn because at the end of the day
they have more power and so it's worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't expect to learn something subntantial overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With focused practice over time, you can master new hard things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Tim's a little less sympathetic than I'd be in my classroom but that's
okay - Tim's talking about teaching developers a new language and so I
think he's view is appropriate and correct there. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is that learning does take time. You can create the illusion
of results with concentrated coaching and flashy tools but real
education takes work and time &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/posts/learning_languages/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A couple of years ago I was speaking to a non-teacher friend who had
just run a month long intensive "coding" summer program. They were very proud of the work
and what the kids accomplished – "They learned so much… Their
projects were awesome." The group had a reunion some time later. I
asked how much they remembered - "pretty much nothing."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, here's Tim's video. It's about 20 minutes but if you're pressed
for time, just up the speed of playback:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="HTML"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Oi8_eCaBGY"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Oi8_eCaBGY&lt;/a&gt;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="text-footnotes"&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/posts/learning_languages/#fnr.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara"&gt;but work can indeed be fun&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One of the things I mentioned in my post on the &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/cs-educators-stackexchange/"&gt;CS Educators
StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; was the fragmentation of resources for CS Educators. My
friend and fellow CS teacher Ben pointed out that this is appropriate
as we're so young as a community. He's absolutely right but until we
mature, discover-ability can be a problem. We all have our resources
and I for one am frequently surprised when talking to a friend and
discovering that they don't know about a site or a mailing list that
I've known about for years. Likewise, I'm appreciative when others
share resources with me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some collections of information, for instance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred
Thompson&lt;/a&gt; has a list of CS Education bloggers but it's not so easy to
discover and it certainly shouldn't fall on Alfred to maintain such
a list making sure the links are all active and always being
responsible for adding new ones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I've noticed a proliferation of &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;awesome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
lists. These are community curated lists hosted up on GitHub for a
variety of projects. I find myself using &lt;a href="https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs"&gt;awesome-emacs&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python"&gt;awesome-python&lt;/a&gt; more and more and there are tons of other such lists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I thought we, as a community could benefit from such a list. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started one off. It's over at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education"&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education&lt;/a&gt; with instructions on
contributing at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org"&gt;https://github.com/zamansky/awesome-cs-education/blob/master/contributing.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I seeded it with a few items but I'd love everyone to get involved. I
also started it with a few categories and a specific format but I'd
love to see that evolve into something most useful for the community
as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you agree that this could be something useful, please contribute to
it and help spread the word.

    <title>Using Emacs - 34 - ibuffer and emmet</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/</id>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-34-ibuffer-emmet/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-orgffb5b85" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgffb5b85"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgffb5b85"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A couple of quick, unrelated packages today.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
first up, ibuffer. If you keep Emacs open all the time, you'll start
to accumulate buffers. Last time, I talked about using &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-33-projectile-jump"&gt;projectile&lt;/a&gt; and
how that can help when navigating between buffers. IBuffer is another
one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Out of the box, &lt;code&gt;C-x C-b&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the Emacs &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;list-buffers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
command. It brings up a buffer with all the buffers listed inside
it. You can navigate that buffer and hit enter on a particular buffer
to go to it. You can also mark buffers and then operate on all the
marked buffers. Hitting &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the list-buffers buffer brings up
more details. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
IBuffer is like list-buffers on steroids. It looks much nicer and I
think it has more functionality (again hitting &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the buffer
brings up help). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
IBuffer really shines though, once you start customizing it. I found
&lt;a href="http://martinowen.net/blog/2010/02/03/tips-for-emacs-ibuffer.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post by Martin Owen which shows how to customize the way ibuffer
appears. You can group buffers however you want or even omit some from
the listing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here's my configuration (mostly stolen from Owen):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global-set-key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;kbd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"C-x C-b"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'ibuffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ibuffer-saved-filter-groups&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;quote &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"default"&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"dired"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dired-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"org"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^.*org$"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"web"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;web-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;js2-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"shell"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;eshell-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"mu4e"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"\*mu4e\*"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"programming"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;
			       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;python-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
			       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;c++-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"emacs"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt;
			 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^\\*scratch\\*$"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
			 &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"^\\*Messages\\*$"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
	       &lt;span class="p"&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'ibuffer-mode-hook&lt;/span&gt;
	  &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ibuffer-auto-mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;"default"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; don't show these&lt;/span&gt;
					&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;(add-to-list 'ibuffer-never-show-predicates "zowie")&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Don't show filter groups if there are no buffers in that group&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ibuffer-show-empty-filter-groups&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Don't ask for confirmation to delete marked buffers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ibuffer-expert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org140cd17" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org140cd17"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org140cd17"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The video also shows &lt;a href="https://github.com/smihica/emmet-mode"&gt;emmet&lt;/a&gt; mode. A terrific mode for quickly creating
HTML and CSS. I tried it a long time ago when it was called zencoding
and found it lacking but after watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGPv7jsQGpc&amp;amp;t=329s"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; at Build Fun Things
I started playing with it again. It's a real winner.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Here's the config I'm using:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;use-package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;emmet-mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:ensure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:config&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'sgml-mode-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'emmet-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Auto-start on any markup modes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'web-mode-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'emmet-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Auto-start on any markup modes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add-hook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'css-mode-hook&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="ss"&gt;'emmet-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; enable Emmet's css abbreviation.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-org503becf" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org503becf"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org503becf"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educators StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; is now in public beta. For those of you
who are not in tech, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange"&gt;StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; is a network of question answering
sites. &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com"&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most famous - many peoples go to
site for computer science and programming questions and answers. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
During this period of public beta the site will be working on defining
itself and also on developing a critical mass of users. I hope the
site succeeds and I encourage everyone to &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;, ask questions,
answer some and let's all see where this goes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An interesting difference between StackExchanges and most other
communities is that it's a question answering site not a discussion
board or shared resource collection. This works well for programming
questions where you can share a code snippet, algorithm, or derivation
which can be shown to be correct. We'll see how it works for something
more nebulous like education. The voting system should help but the CS
education community is already awash with anointed thought leaders
with little or no teaching or CS experience. It will also be
interesting to see how things develop given that, by and large, K12
educators know a whole lot more about teaching than those in higher ed
while the on the flip side, the professors are generally much
more knowledgeable about the subject matter and then you have the
education researcher which is another beast altogether. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Part of me thinks that discussion could be more valuable than answers
and in fact, I'm finding the comments which are more discussion like
to be more interesting, but that's just me. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A side thing I noticed was that the moderators have taken to asking
contributors not to link to other sites but to either write self
contained answers. I understand this desire to have everything under
your roof but it strikes me as wanting to use their silo instead of
someone else's silo. This happened to me on an answer because I had
already written a series of blog posts on the subject. Admittedly, I
just put up four links and could have (and will) provide more context
but I also had no desire to rewrite my content just to share info that
was already out there. Likewise there was a question that was posed on
A* which led to &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/a-star-is-born/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to share my thoughts with "my"
community as well as on the stackexchange and didn't want to have to
do the same thing twice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the moderators claims is that a link might not be
permanent. This is true. My blog might not be around in 5 years but
then the CS Educators StackExchange might not as well. I hope both are
around and thriving but time will tell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This also got me thinking about the  mish mash of
CS Educator communities floating around. I'm familiar with and a
member of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few Facebook groups (CS Education, CS Education Discussion, AP
Comp Sci, APCSP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CS Education subreddit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of mailing lists (the College Board AP Community, SIGCSE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few blogs are kind of communities in that there's a core group of
readers but discussion is pretty sparse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Are there others I'm not aware of?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This has led to a lot of duplication and some fragmentation and there
is a concern about silos. The Facebook groups are very much a silo and
to a certain extent so are the mailing lists. I guess the SIGCSE list
is more community run than the College Board one, but still. Blogs are
our own personal islands so while I wish more people would both blog
and comment about CS Ed they're not necessarily open and permanent
either. At least with some blogs and with the subreddit and
stackexchange we can, if we want, download all of the data if we want
and preserve it for posterity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't know if there's a solution - maybe we should set up a &lt;a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse"&gt;discourse&lt;/a&gt;
instance - something really open and accessible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In any event, please do check out the &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educators StackExchange&lt;/a&gt; and
let's all help it become the best question answering resource it can
be for our community.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disclosing Bugs - requiring a project roadmap</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/</id>
    <updated>2017-06-13T16:30:27-04:00</updated>

    </author>
    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/"/>
    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-org7f35a05" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org7f35a05"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7f35a05"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over on Facebook, a fellow CS educator &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; made a comment on something he
wanted to try with his students this summer: having the students
pre-disclose bugs when they submit their projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The post was asking for any links to "the literature." I can't speak
to that but I I've done something similar to what the post was asking
about so, as per usual, I thought I'd write about it here. It may not
be "research" but I'm more interested in teacher practices than ivory
towers anyway so here goes…
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orga467f3e" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orga467f3e"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga467f3e"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At a very basic level, I ask my students to provide a roadmap to any
project they submit - usually in a readme file. I basically ask:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's cool and I should make sure to check out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What doesn't work, where were the sticking points and what's the
status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I tell my students that when I test the project, I'm not "out to get
them" and by their telling me how to navigate the project, it makes
sure I see things in the best possible light. I also tell them that I
will be more harsh on bugs that they don't tell me about -
particularly bugs that only occur some of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
I also encourage (and sometimes require) that students maintain a
changelog in their repo and also sometimes encourage them to have a
todo list and list of bugs and for longer projects, I expect to see
these and the readme updated over the course of the project (which
should always be up to date on &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, Dropbox or wherever the project
is living). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When the students provide a good write up it makes evaluating the
project much easier.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
When students buy in, they're hopefully thinking more deeply about
their projects in terms of design and implementation and also from the
point of view of someone else using their product. When they maintain
the readme and other files over time, it also enables me to better
support them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-org9b85f5a" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org9b85f5a"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9b85f5a"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, does this work? Yes but with some caveats. It works better once
the class and teacher know each other. If the students trust the
teacher they're more likely to be open and honest when they write up
the project. On the other hand, there will always be some students to
"phone it in" and do the bare minimum in terms of writing up their
projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line is that having the students do this is has a low cost
and is beneficial to both the students and the teacher. When it works,
it's great and when it doesn't, it's still pretty good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="footnotes"&gt;Footnotes: &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="text-footnotes"&gt;

&lt;div class="footdef"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/disclosing-bugs/#fnr.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;div class="footpara"&gt;&lt;p class="footpara"&gt;
I'm not sharing names from the Facebook post because it was
made in a semi-private forum and I haven't asked permission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Over on the &lt;a href="https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/"&gt;CS Educator StachExchange&lt;/a&gt;, which is in private beta for a
few more days, I saw a post asking about how to introduce the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"&gt;A*
search algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I taught A* as part of the APCS class at Stuy so I thought I'd talk
about what I did here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some time around mid year, we get to intermediate recursion. This is
about the time, give or take, when we talk about the nlogn sorts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also build a recursive maze solver. It's a nice algorithm and a
nice little program. It's around 15 lines of code to perform a
recursive depth first search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/dfs.gif" alt="dfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The basic algorithm is:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* solve the maze from an x,ylocation */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Yay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;We&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;found&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nf"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wall&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;previous&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;mark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;space&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="nf"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice lesson because in addition to all the recursion stuff, we
also get to talk about state space, state space search, backtracking,
efficiency concerns and much more. After we finish the maze solver, we also talk about
other problems that can be similarly examined using state-space search
like the knights tour and N-queens problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A month or so later, when we're learning about stacks and queues as
data structures, we revisit the maze solver. This time we solve the
problem in a more general way. We talk about using a data structure to
hold the set of nodes that we're aware of and that we want to visit
next. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;start&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;goal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;adjacent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;yet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;mark&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;visited&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;structure&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As we write the solution, we see that using a queue for this
data structure yields a breadth first search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/bfs.gif" alt="bfs.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
while using a stack yields depth first. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this leads to a discussion as to how deciding on which
locations to look at next can greatly influence the steps to the
exit. From here it's easy to see that you can use a heuristic to order
the nodes in our data structure so that we explore "better"
possibilities first. The data structure becomes a priority queue and
we finally get to both "best first" and A* search:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/astar/astar.gif" alt="astar.gif" align="center" height="200px"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a nice sequence of lessons, albeit lessons spread out over
months. The end result is that the students see both the need and
motivation for something like A* and they see that it's not hard to
implement. One basic routine where you can plug in one of three data
structures - stack, queue, or priority queue to get very different
results.

    <title>Python - Editor or IDE</title>

&lt;h2 id="org2ef5a3c"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2ef5a3c"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Earlier today I read Garth Flint's latest post on &lt;a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/2017/05/25/python-editors-simple-wins/%0A"&gt;choosing a Python
environment for his classes&lt;/a&gt;. While our classes and populations are
different it looks like Garth and I share a lot of thoughts on the
subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I started to write a comment to leave on Garth's blog but since it was
getting a little long I thought I'd write it up as a post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The question of development environment can be an important one and
can make a big difference. When I designed the intro course at Stuy,
the fact that Dr. Scheme existed made the use of Scheme in the class
an option. Without it as a supportive and simple environment for the
students I probably wouldn't have been able to use Scheme even though
I really liked it as a teaching and learning tool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Garth writes about issues relating to choosing a local development
environment so that's what I'm going to stick to here. If you want an
online environment check out &lt;a href="http://codesters.com"&gt;Codesters&lt;/a&gt; - a terrific online Python
environment with lots of educational support materials and features
and &lt;a href="http://repl.it"&gt;repl.it&lt;/a&gt; - an online environment that supports many languages and
is also developing great teacher and class support – I very much like
both of these platforms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The first question is editor or IDE?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a user, I'm very pro editor. Learn a tool that you can customize to
your tastes and that will work for all sorts of text editing chores
from coding to document preparation to scheduling and more and you're
in great shape. Personally, I'm an &lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs"&gt;Emacs wonk&lt;/a&gt; but there are other
choices as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a teacher, though, Emacs or another programmers editor can be
overwhelming for younger students and rank beginners. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This can make IDEs attractive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some IDEs are too big and cumbersome and can add even more cognitive
load than an editor - think Eclipse for Java development. If you think
writing
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
is a lot of overhead, just wait until you have a novice try to start a
Java project in Eclipse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Other IDEs are more streamlined. One common choice is
Idle. It's big advantage is that it's always available and is "part"
of Python. On the other hand, it doesn't seem to add much to a bare
editor and I've found that it can be somewhat confusing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Garth seems to have settled on &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://jetbrains.com"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;. It's pretty
streamlined and really easy to get up and running. JetBrains also
provides a free community edition as well as a heavier professional
one available for purchase. Garth notes that it's a Python only IDE
but JetBrains has similar IDEs for a whole bunch of languages and I
seem to recall you can add plugins across their IDEs to basically make
them multi-language development environments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I really like the JetBrains products and if I used an IDE I'm pretty
sure I'd use their products. As a teacher though, I find their IDEs a
little too powerful for my tastes. I want a learner IDE to provide the
bare minimum of features - an interactive REPL, a code window, run and
debug buttons, some completion and help - but to make those features
really easy to use. JetBrains does a little too much. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What I ended up using in the past is &lt;a href="http://drpython.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Dr Python&lt;/a&gt;. For me it hit the
sweet spot. As an added bonus we were already using Dr. Racket (nee
Dr. Scheme) and Dr. Java so our students had a similar environment
across languages and even NetLogo looked and behaved similarly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is there a right answer? Probably not. Just as with choosing a first
language there are always trade offs. Besides, if you don't have the
right solution, there will be another one next week. Just recently I
saw &lt;a href="http://thonny.org/"&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt;. A new beginners IDE for python. It looks interesting
and worth checking out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The right IDE can make a big difference while keeping the overhead low
and giving just the right amount of support. For me, the last time
around it was Dr. Python. For Garth, it looks like PyCharm fits the
bill. Looking at the overall plan, I usually start the kids off with a
simple learners IDE and then transition them to a programmers editor
like Emacs as they gain more comfort and experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a postscript, let me share these links on how I use Emacs for
Python development (each with a video) as well as my series on how I
use Emacs in general:

    <title>Designing a course with constraints</title>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div id="outline-container-org74017b4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="org74017b4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74017b4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One of the hats I wear at Hunter is to build a new &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-03-29-hunter-cs.html"&gt;CS Honors program&lt;/a&gt;
and to bring my particular brand of insanity to &lt;a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-cs-important"&gt;Hunter College CS&lt;/a&gt; as a
whole.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday was my last class for the semester so I thought I'd write a
bit about the course.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For the Fall semester, I taught an intro programming course to the
entire cohort. For some in the cohort, this was their first exposure
to CS. Others had one or more classes under their belt. It was a
Python based programming class and a big part of it was to start
building the cohort into a community. I'm going to work on tweaking
what I taught for next time around but the constraints of designing
such a course are pretty common – an intro course where the students
all want to be there the level of previous experience varies to some degree.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Second semester was more of a challenge. The "next" course was CSCI
135, CS 100 - like APCS but in C++. I could teach that but since some
of my students had APCS credit, they didn't need 135. This would break
up the group. There was also the issue of the students getting credit
for the course without showing any proficiency in C++.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, Hunter requires students in 135 to take CSCI 136. A 1
credit programming lab. It meets once a week in a computer lab and the
students complete a weekly programming assignment. The lab meets for 2
hours. The instructor goes over anything that's needed for the lab
that hasn't been covered yet and then the students work independently
(with the instructors support) on the lab. Overall it works well. It
makes sure the students are spending at least a couple of hours a week
coding in a supported environment.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
How did 136 help me? I taught a 3 credit course where 1 day was
basically the lab component (what the students were to do in 136) and
one day was enrichment - the stuff I was going to do with them. This
enabled us keeping the cohort together and it also made sure that by
taking the class, the honors cohort members with AP credit would
indeed get up to speed in C++.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was happy with the basic structure. I was able to cover some topics
in project development, testing, debugging, and software engineering but the
designing and teaching the class proved to be challenging for a number
of reasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One was timing. The lab class meets 1 day a week for 1 hour. My class,
2 days a week for 1 hour 15. This meant that if we were to keep the
lab to one day either the students would have less time or I'd have to
impose on them to stay late or come early. I wasn't happy with that
but given the inconsistency in the way the other sections handled lab
timings, I think it worked out OK.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of the other difficulties included:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-org17b7dfb" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org17b7dfb"&gt;The language was C++:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org17b7dfb"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the labs were to be done in C++, I had to use that as the
language for the class. That meant no "fun" libraries or frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org0bb58fa" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org0bb58fa"&gt;The labs were solo assignments:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0bb58fa"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the labs were solo projects and there was one per week it made
it very difficult to structure group experiences. I wanted to cover
things like group development, code review, working off of other
peoples code bases but this proved difficult with an outside separate
lab being handed down each week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-org5227042" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="org5227042"&gt;Someone else dictated the language sequence:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5227042"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The labs were designed to support what the students were learning in
135 and were only distributed a day or two before the week was to
start. This meant that I couldn't plan too far ahead and had to adjust
frequently. This should be easier next year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="outline-container-orgba6d2a4" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="orgba6d2a4"&gt;Labs didn't match the supplemental material:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgba6d2a4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best example of this was when we were talking about testing. We
ended up using &lt;a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch"&gt;Catch&lt;/a&gt; as a testing framework. The problem was that
right afterwards the lab (and also 135 project) didn't lend themselves
to using a testing framework like catch. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There were more challenges but overall I think the class went fairly
well. I'll know more when I get feedback from the students and when we
all look back next year with some perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's been an interesting experience designing a class that had to
interleave with another, existing class. I've designed many classes
over the years and I know that whatever you plan, it probably changes
once you're actually in the classroom and working with the kids, or as
Mike Tyson said: "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the
mouth." This has been a little more of a challenge but I think the
first go through went well and that the course will get better and be
better defined as we go through a couple more iterations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
