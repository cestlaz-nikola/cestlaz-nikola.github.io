&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;a class="center" href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-start.png"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-start.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgheadline1"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2016/01/15/shift-image.html#.Vpvy4x8SrmE"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; we took a look at implementing a Cellular Automaton in
NetLogo to do some simple image manipulation. We just scratched the
surface. In class, the kids write pretty nice Photoshop Light
applications. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today we'll look at some more ambitious problem solving - using a
Cellular Automaton to find a path through a maze. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgheadline2"&gt;Part 1 - finding possible paths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We'll use the image above as an example and a live model with all the
code is at the end of this post.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Each square of the maze is a
NetLogo patch. White square represent possible paths, Red is our
entrance, green our exit. As we explore the maze, we'll color the
cells yellow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Remember, in  a Cellular Automaton (CA), each cell makes a decision as to
it's next state based on information about its neighbors (up, down,
left, and right only in this case).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, if every cell is looking around at it's neighbors, most cells
don't have enough information. The only white cell that might be on
the path from entrance to exit is the one next to the entrance - it
might be on the path.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This leads us to the first step of our CA rule set:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-netlogo"&gt;; if I have a green neighbor, I might be on the path, turn yellow
ask patches with [pcolor = white] [
  if any? neighbors with [pcolor = red] [
   set pcolor yellow
  ] 
]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(click images to enlarge)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-1.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-1.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Next time through, we notice that a cell might be on the path if it's
white and it has either red or yellow neighbors.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-2.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-2.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-3.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-3.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-4.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-4.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Eventually, we end up with a yellow abutting green - the exit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-found.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-found.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Notice that each yellow cell is also numbered. The number indicates
how many steps it took to get there from the entrance. The
implementation is trivial:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by giving each patch a variable &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and starting it at 0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a cell is about to turn yellow, it should look at it's yellow
or red neighbors, ask for their &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; value (they'll all be the
same - think about why), and set it's &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; value to one more
than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We'll use these step numbers to recover the actual shortest path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="orgheadline3"&gt;Part 2 - recovering the shortest path.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can now use the yellow patches with the step numbers to find our
way back. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're going to build a solution set.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="org-ol"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start with an empty solution set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the only green cell not in the solution set (let's call it &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;'s yellow neighbor with lowest step number to turn
itself green (that cell will be &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; next time around).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; into the solution set (leaving the new green cell as
the only green cell not in the solution set).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat 2 - 5 until we're back at the entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-17-maze-ca.html/" data-featherlight="/img/maze-ca/maze-back-1.png"&gt;
&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-back-1.png"&gt;

&lt;img class="smaller" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze-solved.png"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is one of my favorite intro topics. It's using a CA - something
normally just presented as a toy idea, to solve a real problem. It
reinforces parallel processing and foreshadows all sorts of pathfinding
ideas to come.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Below is the complete NetLogo program. You can look at the code by
clicking on the code tab at the bottom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To run:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sets up all the variables and clears the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;buildmaze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; builds a random maze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;solve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a toggle to run through an entire solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; single steps through the CA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;reset&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Resets all the variables and recolors the maze to
unsolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other buttons are toggles for drawing your own maze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="center frame"&gt;
&lt;iframe class="center frame" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/maze-ca/maze.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
We've been using &lt;a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/"&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; in our intro course for years. It's a
wonderful programming environment. Many of you recall the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)"&gt;Logo&lt;/a&gt;
programming language. NetLogo is like Logo but instead of programming
a turtle, you write a program that's run by multiple, perhaps hundreds
of turtles and also by the world the turtles live on. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of the reasons we like it are that it's:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An easy accessible textual programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes building a graphical interface trivial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;great for modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with tons of demo models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And now, with the latest version, NetLogo programs/models can be
deployed as web sites. All you have to do is save your program as
"NetLogo Web" and put it up on a observer somewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't you should download and install NetLogo, run it, then
go to the file menu and look at the built in models.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also enjoy playing with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton"&gt;Cellular Automata&lt;/a&gt; and NetLogo's a wonderful
platform to play with. The turtles live on a grid of patches and just
like the turtles, the patches will all run your program over and over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The patches make perfect cells for a cellular automaton and you can
implement a rule set in your patches. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NetLogo even comes with a bunch of built in demo models for Cellular
Automata including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"&gt;Conway's Game of Life&lt;/a&gt;, probably the most famous CA.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, Conway's Game of Life is somewhat cliche and while
I find it fascinating, it doesn't really solve a practical problem, at
least on on the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, I was looking for something more practical to do and something
where we could explore some deeper CS concepts. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Image manipulation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In class, we make a Cellular Automaton where each cell or patch is a
pixel in an image. In NetLogo, you can do this with the
"import-pcolors" command. Lower down, I have a demo that just manually
colors patches - the web version of NetLogo doesn't yet support that
command.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Task 1 - what if we want to shift the image over? The kids come up
with a solution pretty quickly: "We can just have each patch ask its
neighbor for its color." Here's the code they try:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-netlogo"&gt;; ask each patch to set its color to the color of the
; patch at relative location -1,0
to shift-naive
  ask patches [ set pcolor [pcolor] of patch-at -1 0]
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To see what happens, scroll down to the NetLogo model below, click on
setup and then hit the &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;shift-naive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; button a few times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It doesn't work. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What's going on?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's a synchronization issue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Suppose we have the following three cells in a row:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/shift-image/image1.png" alt="image1.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If cell 3 asks cell 2 it's color before cell 2 asks cell 1's color, we
get the desired result:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/shift-image/image2.png" alt="image2.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But if cell 2 asks cell 1 for it's color first then cell 3 will
actually get cell 1's color:
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/shift-image/image3.png" alt="image3.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So now we have the students thinking about synchronization and
parallel processing and they don't even know it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The solution's pretty easy, break the problem up into two steps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, have every patch ask its neighbor for its color and then once
everyone knows their neighbor's color, then change:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-html"&gt;patches-own [next-color]

to shift-correct
  ; figure out my next color
  ask patches [ set next-color [pcolor] of patch-at -1 0 ]
  ; then switch to it
  ask patches [ set pcolor next-color]
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can run that by clicking &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; again and then &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;shift-correct&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; a
few times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There's some of the beauty of NetLogo - we can get kids to think about
some deep concepts while playing with an easy to use, fun, interactive
environment with a real textual programming language.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Stay tuned for part 2 when I'll talk about creating a cellular
automaton that can solve a maze.

    <title>CS Ed Predictions 2015</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-01-04-predictions-2015.html/</id>
    <updated>2015-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;style&gt;
div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I just read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo"&gt;Alfred Thompson's&lt;/a&gt; predictions for next year. I was going
to leave a comment but since it would have gotten somewhat long
winded, I thought I'd comment in a post of my own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't read Alfred's post yet, check it out:
&lt;a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html"&gt;http://blog.acthompson.net/2015/01/computer-science-education-predictions.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-unnumbered-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unnumbered-1"&gt;On more states allowing CS to count for a graduation requirement:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alfred's probably right but I'm leery. Sure, it could end up terrific
but I could see a number of ways this could play out badly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We could end up with non-cs classes to count as CS or we could see
schools allowing real CS to count but there would be no incentive for
a school to actually create any meaningful CS classes
much less for kids to take them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I guess the root of my concern probably relates two of my concerns
about education in general:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real, experienced teachers aren't driving policy in education in
general and CS is and will  be no different. We're going to be left
with something forced down from above and I fear it will be bad.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="org-ul"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not a big fan of education education. As schools of education
get involved they will have more of a voice. I think one of the
worst things to happen to math education over the course of my
career has been "Math Ed." I fear CS Ed will have the same effect
on K12 CS education.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Maybe I'm a pessimist or maybe I've just been burned one to many times
or maybe it's that as a public school teacher I see the negative
effect of politics and money on public education but at least in NYC I
see where the decision making is coming from and I'm not encouraged.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, even if I'm right and the powers that be really
screw things up,there should always be at least a few people who see
through they hype and that's where I can continue to do positive work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-unnumbered-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unnumbered-2"&gt;On Python continuing to grow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's been one of my go to languages for a while now. I've been using
it in and out of classes since some time in the mid 90s.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't see it replacing Java in AP CS and it looks like Scratch has
the inside track CS Principles but it's good for so many things and
has such a low cost of entry, I again feel that Alfred's right. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fact that it's easy for a non-cs teacher to pick up, at least to a
limited degree, will certainly help the charge. I'm not sure if long
term, this is a good thing, but it will help to push python's growth in education.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a side note on Java – I'm not personally a fan, but there good things in there that would be lost 
with a total shift to languages like Python.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-unnumbered-3" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unnumbered-3"&gt;On CS Principles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do see a time where the course is forced on Stuy but I'm
not worrying about it for the moment. I think we already teach a
stronger course and by the time CS Principles becomes an issue at
Stuy, I'll probably be gone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-unnumbered-4" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unnumbered-4"&gt;Chromebooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could see chromebooks working out for CS but only if schools don't
lock them down. Out of the box, you can only use cloud based
development environments. This is surely limiting but if you have the bandwidth, between
&lt;a href="http://codesters.com/"&gt;codesters.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://koding.com/"&gt;koding.com&lt;/a&gt;, cloud9, Dr.Racket and assorted other tools
you can certainly do some good CS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The upside comes when you can drop into the Linux shell. I've been
playing with a C720 Intel chromebook recently. It's small and
lightweight and once I set it up, it was running Dr. Racket, NetLogo,
Python, Java, Processing (all with a fairly hefty Emacs install).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Will it run everything? I don't know, but if I can get a new lab of
computers and have the freedom to custom install the machines, I'm
seriously considering chromebooks. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm also recommending them to my kids looking for a cheap portable
development environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

as is your blog in general.

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, my buddy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snikolov"&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to this article: 
&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/12/to-address-techs-diversity-woes-start-with-the-vanishing-comp-sci-classroom/"&gt;"To address tech’s diversity woes, start with the vanishing Comp Sci classroom"&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It gives a reasonable overview of the gender issues in computer
science education. The article talks about the drop in popularity of
the old Advanced Placement AB course and its eventually being dropped
as well as thoughts on how the current A course is pretty dry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It made me think about the old vs new exams. The current APCS A exam
is roughly analogous to a typical college 101 course: programming in
one language and one paradigm. The old AB class represented a 101 and
a 102 with the 102 being data structures and algorithms. Much more
interesting for both guys and girls. Over the years, the AP A exam has
become more and more vocational, at least in my opinion, and that
makes matters worse. Its more and more about using the language and
built in collections and less about thinking and problem
solving. What's fun about that?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Of course, we teach our version, a super-set, of the AB curriculum over
the course of a school year.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Interesting that even though we teach that old school hardcore CS, we
far exceed the national numbers in terms of gender balance, but more
on that later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the big things going on right now is the AP CS Principles
course. There's some good stuff in there but I've got a lot of
questions. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To start, I'm tired of hearing that it's a college level course. If
a course is designed so that a 10th grader can be successful, it's not
college level. I do understand that it's being taught in places like
Berekely (and as an aside I both like and greatly respect Dan Garcia,
who's the architect of one version of CS principles - the Beauty and
Joy of Computing, and his work). If my kids were doing in college what
they could have been doing in 10th grade, something's wrong. That's
not to say that you can't have a similar course at both levels, just
that there's a &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; difference between a 10th grader and a college
freshman. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I also take issue with the drag and drop languages in high school and
beyond. True, there's a low cost of entry, but then it's limiting in
oh so many ways. Much slower than a keyboard interface, limited screen
real estate, and no clear exit to traditional textual
programming. Scratch and the like are probably good for younger kids,
but I've had to rescue many a kid from the damage done by drag and
drop. I'm not advocating starting a high schooler in Haskell with Vim
but there are plenty of tools that are both accessible, easy entry,
fun, but at the same time real.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We also see the proliferation of all girl after school programs. I
don't have any problem with this per se. I think we need some all
girls and some co-ed. In fact, one of the young ladies in our summer
program commented on how much she liked the fact that we weren't all
girls but we created a wonderful environment where everyone felt
comfortable and supported. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some of those programs do great things in terms of exposing girls to
role models and to what's possible. My issue is with the actual
education, notably because these programs invariably don't have real
educator/computer scientists running the show. They teach a watered
down CS or conversely too much too quickly and then the girls are
clobbered at the next level, they start doubting themselves and they
change majors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The problems with these after school programs as well as with CS
Principles are the same. A few of my students who studied CS at
Harvard framed it nicely when talking about Harvard's highly
publicized CS50 course (I'm paraphrasing and combining thoughts here):
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They don't really teach anything, you've got to do it mostly on your
own. In the end you don't really learn anything.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Then, they go on to Harvard's next real CS class - functional
programming with no real preparation and they drop like flies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, what do you do?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You do what we did.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I developed an intro course over 10 years ago. The new AP Principles
course has some overlap in terms of concepts but one big difference is
that we dive into programming using two real languages. &lt;a href="http://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, which
is mathy functional and &lt;a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml"&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; which is visual and interactive but
still text based. We then move on to a number of really neat concepts
in Python. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People say, "Oh, you do the NetLogo because it's visual and appeals to
girls." No - we do NetLogo because it's cool and it appeals to
kids. Same with Scheme. Show me a girl that loves the visual stuff,
I'll show you a girl that loves Scheme's functional goodness. I might
only be a dopey old school teacher, but I really believe "kids are
kids."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On top of this, you get great teachers that really know their stuff
(and we've built plenty of them over the years) and create a culture
with everyone's accepted and good things happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
By the time our kids leave us, they've got enough under their belts so
they not only know their stuff but they have the confidence that they
know their stuff. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
How does it work for us? Nationally, about 19% of APCS test takers are
women. At Stuy, we hover around 30%. My Software Development, Post AP
classes are also around 30% so we keep them. Oh, and Stuy is only 40%
female and we do much worse than the national averages in other
traditionally male dominated fields such as physics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, I was talking to one of our CSTUY hackers as we ended the
day. We were talking about possible directions to go in after the new
year. We could stay graphical, go to text processing, look at some
hardcore algorithms and more. I asked Aruna what she thought. Her
answer: "It's all fun."

div.center {text-align:center;}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If I'm doing my job right, by the time my kids graduate they can learn
on their own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's like when two years ago, before starting her summer internship,
Batya listed all the tools and technologies she had to work with. When
I pointed out that she hadn't ever used any of them before and asked
how she was going to deal with it, she replied "I'll figure it out."
And she did. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the summer, Dina told a similar story about her
internship and how she knew she'd figure everything out because of the
solid background she got by going through StuyCS. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I loved both these stories.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But getting the kids there takes time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, in my AP classes, I assigned three &lt;i&gt;codingbat&lt;/i&gt; problems. I
decided to go objects first this time round so we haven't done any
language constructs. The problems were simple String manipulations but
I added one that needed conditionals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today we went over them. Most of the class solved the assignment and
most had either no trouble or had to do just a little work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I asked what about that last problem might have caused some
difficulty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They couldn't figure it out, it seemed pretty straighforward. After a
number of guesses, one student  said:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"Wait, we don't know ifs"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That was it. They didn't realize that they had taught themselves
something new.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This, of course, doesn't just happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They've seen conditionals in all sorts of guises.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Scheme:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-scheme"&gt;(&lt;span style="color: #a020f0;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; boolean_expression
  True_part
  False_part)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
NetLogo:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="example"&gt;
if boolean [True part]

and

ifelse boolean [True part][ False part]
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and Python:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="org-src-container"&gt;

&lt;pre class="src src-python"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a020f0;"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color: #483d8b;"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;:
  s1
&lt;span style="color: #a020f0;"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; bool2:
  s2
&lt;span style="color: #a020f0;"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;:
  s3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
and so on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So they new the concept, from there it was just details.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Some said they just wrote it and it worked. Some said they looked up
sample code. Most didn't think they were doing anything new.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was pretty awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's still a long road before they graduate, but we're getting there.

    <title>Layers of a lesson</title>
    <id>http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-12-17-layers-of-a-lesson.html/</id>
    <updated>2012-12-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

    <summary type="html">&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img width="50%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/turtle-anim.gif" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My last post I was talking about the fact that as teachers, our
knowledge and experience is frequently trivialized. The tenor of the
times is that anyone can design a course, anyone can teach, and in
fact, we don't even need teachers, just videos or computer based
systems. If you've ever tutored a friend, you're more than qualified. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That might be a strong statement but everywhere you look you see
"education" programs designed and implemented by non teachers. It
seems that it's believed that teaching only involves the most
superficial of transfers of information.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Today, I thought I'd look at a lesson I taught the other week. How
I've seen similar material presented and how my colleagues and I might treat
the subject.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We use &lt;a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/"&gt;NetLogo&lt;/a&gt; in
our Sophomore level intro course. It's a highly parallel version of
logo. It's very visual, it's great for modeling and you can introduce
deep, meaningful concepts such as parallel processing in a gentle
manner.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Early on the kids have to learn how to manipulate the turtles. In
NetLogo you write a single program and it's run by all the turtles "at
once." The image above is one of their early "experiments." Have the
turtles wiggle out of the center, but when they get to an invisible
border, start spinning. They do a number of variations on this theme.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
A solution might look like this:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
; asked in a turtle context
to gospin
  ifelse abs xcor &amp;lt; 8 or abs ycor &amp;lt; 8 
    [ wiggle ] ; wiggle implementation not shown
    [ left 5 ]
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's call level one just talking about the solution by looking at the
program as a sequence of instructions. Specifically relating the
instructions to the problem, showing how it solves it, and that's it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is the simplest level. A book, video, or online courseware can
approach teaching at this level. A non computer scientist teacher or a
non teacher computer scientist could do so as well. Students might
learn a bit but I wouldn't hope for much inspiration or
creativity to come out of it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let's move to level two. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here we might talk about "what the turtles are doing." They're always
doing something, either wiggling or spinning. This is a step in the
right direction. When done right, the students start thinking about
the problem in a more general sense but they're still looking at the
problem as something that exists only in the world of NetLogo. They
are more likely develop patterns than in level one, but it's still
limited.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Level three is where things get interesting. On the surface, the
problem is just a nice introduction to programming turtles in
NetLogo. At a deeper level, it's an opportunity to introduce the kids
to State Machines. A new way of thinking about problems and problem
solving.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Students understand the idea of a "state." For example, in class,
they're in a "seated state," maybe in a "note taking state," etc. It's
easy to see that they don't know what their day will bring but they
constantly make decisions based on their "state." Likewise, they can
think about the turtle as in a state. It's either in a wiggling state
or a spinning state and based on their situation they can either
continue in their current state or transition to the other one:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img width="50%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/spin-state.png" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This opens up a new way of thinking and it's easy to see how this
extends to other problems, for example, a ghost from pacman:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img width="50%" src="http://cestlaz.github.io/img/pacman-ghost-state.png" class="" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A good teacher thinks about working across these levels. He adjusts
based on the class and looks for opportunities to develop these deeper
concepts.</summary>
