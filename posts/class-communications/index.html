Right now I'm on vacation in Harrogate England. Natan  is here taking part in the International Gilbert and Sullivan
Festival so Devorah and I came along as tourists. Today we went to Knaresborough:

Normally when traveling I try to get everything in and that leaves me
pretty exhausted at the end of each day. Since this time we'll be here
for around two weeks, I'm trying a less hectic pace. Do some touring
along with some rest and relaxation. I actually gave myself the time
to do some recreational reading and just finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Comeback-LeMond-American-Cycling-Legendary-ebook/dp/B075VDQD2W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1533756774&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+comeback+de+vise">The Comeback</a> by
Daniel de Vise and have a big queue of what's next.
</p>

<p>
I'm also going to try to get a blog post or two out.
</p>

<p>
One thing I've been meaning to blog about for a while is class
communication and having seen <a href="https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/how-i-use-slack-in-my-courses-a-3-year-reflection-888c7e742d04">this</a> the other day, I guess it's time.
</p>

<p>
In the article, Evan Peck talks about his experience using Slack as a
means of class communications and why he likes it. 
</p>

<p>
Here's my take:
</p>

<p>
Class communication takes many forms. It can be the dissemination of
information such as assignments or announcements, assignment collection,
presenting feedback either on assignments or in general, specific
interactions between the instructor and the students, group
discussions, and cross student interactions. 
</p>

<p>
For sharing and collecting code as well as providing feedback, I like
using <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/sigcse-2017-github-4/">Git and GitHub</a>. I use it for homework, projects, sharing class
code - pretty much anything involving code or student work. That
leaves all of the basic communication platforms. The popular ones
include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The schools CMS – Moodle, Blackboard etc.</li>
<li>Piazza or other forum platforms</li>
<li>Slack and other chat platforms</li>
<li>Facebook groups</li>
<li>old school mail lists</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc596dfa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc596dfa">Blackboard or your school's CMS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc596dfa">
<p>
First up, Blackboard.
</p>

<p>
Just no.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, they're all slow and clunky and usually have an
awkward interface. I've always found them hard to navigate and use and
I find little value added.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2f2ce60" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2f2ce60">Piazza and forum software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2f2ce60">
<p>
<a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a> is a free to use discussion platform. Many schools use
it. Personally, I don't like Piazza but it does have some good points:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Q&amp;A format works pretty well.</li>
<li>It allows anonymous posting which is sometimes desirable.</li>
<li>You can look at participation reports</li>
<li>TAs or instructors can approve questions and answers</li>
</ul>
<p>
There really is a lot to like about it but it doesn't work for
me. Personally, I don't like the interface but that wouldn't be the
deal breaker for me if my kids liked it. The deal breaker for me is
that kids have to actively go to the site. Yes, they can set their
preferences for alerts but if they don't and they don't check the site
regularly they'll miss things. This is a big deal to me. If I send out
something important I have no idea if or when people will check in on
it. For me personally, it's yet another site that I have to actively
and regularly check. 
</p>

<p>
Another interesting thing I learned about Piazza has to do with
students honesty about platforms. Back at Stuy a colleague used Piazza
regularly and was getting good results with it - many active
students. I couldn't get as much buy in. The teacher told me that the
kids said they really liked the platform. A year or two later, I
surveyed the kids in my class – they were in his and other teachers
the previous year or two. I asked them about platforms they used and
how they felt about them. The results were that they used Facebook
groups on their own (I'll talk about them later) and used whatever
platform we required because we required it. Even if they said they
liked it, they really didn't.
</p>

<p>
Last semester I set up a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> server for HunterCS. Discourse is
another discussion platform. I liked the
fact that I could run the server and had ownership of the data. I also
liked the way the forum software worked in general. On the other hand,
it had similar overall problems as Piazza.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd880dd6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd880dd6">Slack</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd880dd6">
<p>
A hot contender and the one that Mr. Peck uses is Slack. It's a chat
platform. It can be a separate app running on your phone or desktop or
you can use a web interface. It has channels for topics, can thread
discussions, it does alerts well and can integrate with tools like
calendars and GitHub. Just like with Piazza, there's a lot to like.
</p>

<p>
My problem with Slack is that it's really for live communication not
asynchronous after hours communication. It works best when you're
working on something and you have your slack window open, you have a
question so you type it in and get immediate answers. It just doesn't
seem to work as well when you don't use it live. You can read the
messages posted since you last checked but it can be really hard to
follow unless people explicitly use the threading.
</p>

<p>
Slack also shares the issue of being another site or application to
use but since it does alerts well it doesn't bother me as much.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0e08b64" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0e08b64">Facebook groups</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0e08b64">
<p>
Facebook groups seem to have been the student go to for a while
now. They create their own teacher/professor free student groups. I
think it's great that they create resources like this and as I tell
them, it's important for them to have a forum that's free from the
teacher's eyes. I mean, how can they plan that surprise party for me
on the class chatroom that I have access to :-). On the other hand,
Facebook groups have some downsides:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not searchable or discoverable. I've seen kids only find out about
them at the end of semesters.</li>
<li>In some cases, each year a new group is created so no institutional
memory develops.</li>
<li>All the info stays in Facebook</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-org495543e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org495543e">Mail lists</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org495543e">
<p>
This all brings me to old school mailing lists. I've been using them
for decades and I keep coming back to them. Since they're just email,
no one has to check a separate app or site. Since they're email, they
support threading. Also as email, they can be public to the list or
private to just one or a few people.
</p>

<p>
Again, they're not perfect - I can't easily set up long term
categories or channels like you can with Slack or Piazza and they
don't integrate with tools like calendars so as with everything else,
there's always some compromise.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5b44166" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5b44166">What do you use?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b44166">
<p>
I think I might try Slack again this semester if the students want to
go for it or maybe discourse. If they don't want to try those, then
it'll be back to mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
What do all of you use? What are the strong and weak points of your
chosen platform and what would make the ideal platform for class
communication?
