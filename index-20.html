We configured emacs by creating a folder named <b>.emacs.d</b> and creating a
file within it named <b>init.el</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the contents of that file:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">inhibit-startup-message</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

The last two <b>inituse-package</b> clauses install two helpful packages:

I'm sure I've mentioned that I've been an Emacs wonk for
decades. Since the mid-80's in fact. I've spent time using other
editors, word processors, and development tools but always find my way
back.
</p>

<p>
I recommend that budding computer science students develop a good tool
set and encourage them to explore Emacs but while it's pretty easy to
load Emacs and find your way around, particularly if you use the mouse
and menus there isn't a clear path to take you from beginner to using
it as an efficient tool let alone customizing it.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/featured">Mattias Petter Johansson</a>, or MPJ who make a weekly video,
I decided to try to create a series of YouTube videos and matching
blog posts. I'll try to post one a week and I'll try to keep the
videos, at least after the first couple to just a few minutes and have
them focus on <a href="http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/01/developing-emacs-micro-habits-text-automation/">micro-habits</a> - one or two small things that you can
bring to your work flow and internalize.
</p>

<p>
The first three four (this one and the next three) will focus on
setting things up. After this post we'll have
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Setting up the package manager</li>
<li>Intro to org-mode (just so that you recognize the markup)</li>
<li>Intro to Elisp (just so you have an idea of those configuration
lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>
and then we're off to the races. Here's what I'm thinking about for
the first few topics after the above mentioned ones:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Efficient Navigation</li>
<li>Windows and Buffers</li>
<li>Theming</li>
<li>Auto Completion</li>
</ul>
<p>
and then a series of short topics to show some of my favorite editing
tools. We'll also cover some larger topics including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python Development</li>
<li>C/C++ Development</li>
<li>Document Preparation</li>
<li>Scheduling / Calendaring / Note Taking</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll put together an index to these posts along with any ancillary
materials here: <a href="file:///stories/emacs">http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs</a>.

This series is going to assume you've installed emacs and worked your
way through the included tutorial.

that I've found useful:

I haven't been teaching this past semester. That's why I haven't been
writing much about lessons. I miss working with students but that will
resume in the fall and this semester has allowed me to get a jump on
new projects.
</p>

<p>
It's also allowed me to look at some student issues from a bit of a
distance.
</p>

<p>
One issue that keeps coming up is cheating. 
</p>

<p>
Some of it, classroom cheating. my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cscheerleader">Ria</a> recently asked a
question on Facebook about it. A nice thread ensued but unfortunately,
it's locked in the Facebook silo. I've got a lot to say on that and
hope to explore it soon but today let's focus on project
cheating - something that could just as easily apply to homeworks and
student essays and research papers as well.
</p>

<p>
One part of the question is on students using code they find out in
the wild. <a href="https://twitter.com/alfredtwo">Alfred</a> wrote a bit about it on his blog <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2016/05/copying-codesteal-from-best.html">here</a> where he points
out some pluses, some minuses, and raises some good thought points.
</p>

<p>
I want to keep it in the class - code sharing amongst students,
project and source code submission, and group projects.
</p>

<p>
Teachers have all sorts of options these days including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using a CMS like Blackboard or Moodle</li>
<li>Dropbox based solutions</li>
<li>Emailing projects</li>
<li>Using development tools and sites such as git with GitHub, BitBucket
or other repository hosting services</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've always been a fan of having the kids learn real software
engineering skills along with the CS so Git, GitHub and public repos
have been my weapon of choice.
</p>

<p>
Interesting enough, I've gotten an earful both from fellow teachers
and professors and online for my stance on public repos. 
</p>

<p>
I keep hearing "the kids will copy from each other" or something like
that. 
</p>

<p>
As Alfred said in his post: "Students have been copying from
classmates for years."
</p>

<p>
Students who want to copy assignments have done so long before we've
been teaching CS and they'll be doing it for years to come. 
</p>

<p>
Using a hidden submission system doesn't help and could hurt.
</p>

<p>
Far better to create an open environment. You get an opportunity to
talk about code sharing, attribution, learning from each other,
supporting each other, and where to draw the line.
</p>

<p>
On top of that, the students learn a real tool set and have a chance
to learn real development methodologies.
</p>

<p>
It's a win all around.
</p>

<p>
Will open repos stop cheating and irresponsible copying? Certainly
not. It could, however, raise awareness. 
</p>

<p>
So what do I do on the cheating front?
</p>

<p>
Besides trying to create a culture where cheating is discouraged,
cooperation is encouraged but where students know the line, I will try
to keep them honest. 
</p>

<p>
Frequently, the day a big project is due, I'll give a quiz on the
project. Students will have to describe parts of the project and what
they did. Either a student will have had to contributed or at least
will have had to have studied the rest of the teams code to pass the
quiz.
</p>

<p>
GitHub also gives tools that help. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the GitHub graph for a project:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/github-graph.png" alt="github-graph.png" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
You can see who did what and when. The teacher can drill down further
to examine the diffs – what code did each student write, when, and
from where. If two students submit very similar code, the commit
timestamps will even tell you who was first.
</p>

<p>
The tooling for teachers could be better but the infrastructure is
there.
</p>

<p>
Technology isn't going to prevent cheating and more often than not, it
seems that measures taken don't stop the bad guys but inconvenience
those trying to do it right.
</p>

<p>
Much better to build a class culture where the kids want to do it the
right way.

Quick post to add to the recent command line fu I've been writing
about.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/dougpete">Douglas Peterson</a> had another <b><b>Whatever happened to</b></b> post. This time
on <a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2016/05/15/whatever-happened-to-6/">Logo</a>. I wanted to reply, talk about NetLogo  and link to some of my
old NetLogo posts to help show how cool it is.
</p>

<p>
Nikola supports tags, makes a nice <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories">tags</a> page and for each tag, a nice
page of all the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/netlogo">links</a>. 
</p>


<p>
Nikola has a plugin <b><b>tags</b></b> which lets you manage tags from the
command line. For instance:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola tags -a netlogo posts/somepost.org
</pre></div>

<p>
Would add the tag <b><b>netlogo</b></b> to the specified post.
</p>

<p>
The problem: The tags plugin only works if the post has a <b><b>tag:</b></b>
line already present in it's header comment and I hadn't put them in
my older posts.
</p>

<p>
I had a bunch of posts, all of them in one directory. All the new ones
were <b><b>.org</b></b> files and had the tag slug. The others were <b><b>.md</b></b> markdown
files and <b><b>.html</b></b> html files. 
</p>

<p>
Here's what a typical top block looks like:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;!--
.. title: Looking for interesting questions
.. slug: 2010-01-03-looking-for-interesting-questions.html
.. date: 2010-01-03
.. type: text
--&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
Sed to the rescue. Here's the what I ended up typing (from within the
posts directory) to add the
<b><b>tags</b></b> slug to the top comments right above the <b><b>.. type: text:</b></b> line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ls *md *html | while read filename
do
    sed "/type: text/ i .. tags: " $filename
done
</pre></div>

<p>
A line at a time:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3f82fe8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3f82fe8">ls *md *html</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f82fe8">
<p>
This lists all the files with that end in <b><b>md</b></b> or <b><b>html</b></b>
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3ecda0a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3ecda0a">| while read filename</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3ecda0a">
<p>
The vertical bar (pipe) sends the output of <b><b>ls</b></b> into the <b><b>while read</b></b>
command. The <b><b>while</b></b> command sets up a loop which, each time
through, reads the next input and places into the variable
<b><b>filename</b></b>. The body of the loop is between the <b><b>do</b></b> and the
<b><b>done</b></b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc417ef1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc417ef1">sed "/ type: text/  i .. tags: " $filename</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc417ef1">
<p>
Sed is the stream editor. The stuff between the slashes finds the line
with the text <b><b>type: text</b></b> in it. The <b><b>i</b></b> inserts a line above and
the rest of the stuff in the quotes is what to insert. The
<b><b>$filename</b></b> expands to each filename, one each time through the
loop.
</p>
</div>

Now all of my files have blank <b><b>tag</b></b> slugs so I can find my netlogo
posts and tag them:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola tags -a netlogo `grep -i -l netlogo posts/*`
</pre></div>

<p>
Any command in backticks expands to the result of the commmand. The
grep command has two argiments: <b><b>-i</b></b> means ignore case so it will
find netlogo, NetLogo, NETLOGO, etc.. The <b><b>-l</b></b> tells grep to just
output the filenames. So, the grep command will expand to a list of
files that mention netlogo. The full command adds the netlogo tag to
all of them.
</p>

<p>
So, just a bit of quick shell scripting and I've:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>modified all old posts to accept tags.</li>
<li>added the netlogo tag to all my netlogo posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find all those posts <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/categories/netlogo">here</a>.

Quick post on why I love the Unix command line.
</p>

<p>
We're busy organizing <a href="http://cstuy.org">CSTUY's</a> first <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/defhacks">hackathon</a>. It's going to be at
<a href="http://sumall.com">SumAll</a>, where we hold our weekly <a href="http://cstuy.org/programs/hacking_sessions">hacking sessions</a> but while taking
registration, we had a little program.
</p>

<p>
The kids signed up on a Google doc but we all know the story – when
people sign up for a free event, even one with free food and t-shirts,
many don't show. I asked all of the applicants to confirm by filling
out a second Google doc.
</p>

<p>
Then it got to reminder time - I wanted to send an email out to all
those kids who signed up on the first form, but hadn't confirmed on
the second. 
</p>

<p>
Two Google spreadsheets with an email field. I needed all the people
on sheet 1 that weren't on sheet 2. I'm sure there's some
spreadsheet-fu that accomplishes this, but nothing I know. I also
could have written a little python script which isn't so bad, but this
was a perfect time to turn to the shell.
</p>

<p>
So, here's how a command line guy would do this.
</p>

<p>
To start, I put the emails in two files: e1 and e2. The first has
all the original applicants, the second those that confirmed.
</p>


<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">

<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">e1</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"> </th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">e2</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">a@a.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">b@b.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">b@b.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">F@f.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">c@c.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">c@c.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">d@d.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">d@d.com</td>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">e@e.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>

<td class="org-left">g@g.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">h@h.com</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
If we put these lists together, any email that appears twice would
indicate that it's the email of someone that confirmed entry. Here we
use cat to catenate e1 and e2 and pipe them through sort.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | sort 
</pre></div>

<p>
First problem –the upper case F – let's use <b><b>tr</b></b> to make
everything lower case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 |  tr A-Z a-z | sort
</pre></div>

<p>
Now we can see the duplicates next to each other. Next, <b><b>uniq
-c</b></b> tells us how many times each line appears:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort
</pre></div>

<p>
I added the sort at the end, but we didn't need it.
</p>

<p>
Here's what we get:
</p>

<p class="verse">
1 a@a.com<br>
 1 c@c.com<br>
 1 c@c.dom<br>
 1 e@e.com<br>
 1 g@g.com<br>
 1 h@hc.om<br>
 2 b@b.com<br>
 2 d@d.com<br>
 2 f@f.com<br></p>

<p>
To pull out the ones that haven't replied I used egrep with a regex
that means "any line that starts with 1 or more spaces followed by the
number 1":
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1"
</pre></div>

<p>
and finally to isolate the emails using sed which removes the spaces
and number 1 from the beginning of the line:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat e1 e2 | tr A-z a-z | sort | uniq -c | egrep "^ +1" | sed "s/\ \+1 //g"
</pre></div>

<p>
Each of the little utilities aren't all too useful by themselves but
if you learn them over time you start thinking about how you can
combine them to solve problems. 
</p>

<p>
If you think this way and know some basic tools, all of a sudden all
manner of text manipulation problems become pretty easy.

<p>
Over in the Facebook AP Computer Science Teachers group someone asked
for thoughts on covering BASH scripting as a post AP topic.
</p>

<p>
A number of us made suggestions. I linked to <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzR7Et9vETt">this</a> old blog post.
</p>

<p>
One group member said she asked around for similar suggestions and the
response she got was "vi and awk." I wanted to jokingly respond "and
after they suggested that they got into their time machine and went
back to the 70's."
</p>

<p>
In all seriousness though, I think that suggesting specific tools or
commands is off base.
</p>

<p>
The important thing to know about Vi is how to get out of it but it
isn't really a tool in the scripting sense. I do think students should
spend a good amount of time learning a powerful editor and should try
bot Emacs (my choice) and Vim but that's another story.
</p>

<p>
I also use AWK but as it's a programming language in it's own right,
I'm not sure if I'd introduce it right off the bat.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of important ideas kids can take away from learning
some Linux (or other Unix flavor):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's something out there besides Windows and MacOS</li>
<li>All about free software</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">The Unix Philosophy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
That last one is the biggie and more specifically, there's a huge
upside in teaching kids the value of "OS as Toolset" where they can
compose the many tools that comprise the Linux experience to get
things done. 
</p>

<p>
I gave an example of that in the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-07-06-spreadsheet-vs-cli.html/#.VzSBHt9vETu">post</a> I previously linked to.
</p>

<p>
For the teacher, that means wrapping your head around that way of
working. Living in the shell and using pipes to connect program to
progarm to program.
</p>

<p>
I'd recommend getting into a time
machine ourselves and taking a look at: 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment" width="250px" align="center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/43/English4.gif" alt="English4.gif" width="250px" align="center"></a>

<p>
It's dated but it's really a great book on getting into the Unix way
of doing things, particularly the chapter about filters. It also has
one of the best and clearest introductions to writing a compiler in
the chapter on program development.
</p>

<p>
As I said, it is dated - shells are much easier to use and much more
robust, there are many more tools now, and they've evolved but it's
really a must read book.
</p>

<p>
In terms of tools, I get a lot of mileage out of:

A nice simple thing you can do with these is clean data. Let's say you
want to do some analytics on a book from Project Gutenberg. You might
want to convert all non letters to spaces, and all letters to lower
case:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cat book.txt | sed "s/[^a-zA-Z ]/ /g | tr A-Z a-z"
</pre></div>

<p>
That sends book.txt into sed which uses a regular expression to convert
no space and letters to spaces. The tr command converts all upper case
letters to lower case.
</p>

<p>
If you want one word per line, add:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "s/\n/g"
</pre></div>

<p>
and maybe get rid of blank lines:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sed "/^$/d"
</pre></div>

<p>
We can now count the number of words in the file using <b><b>*wc</b></b> or even
get counts of all the words:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>| sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</pre></div>

<p>
<b><b>sort</b></b> will sort all the lines, <b><b>uniq -c</b></b> will compress the lines that are
adjacent and the same and give you a count and then <b><b>sort -n</b></b> will
sort the results numerically.
</p>

<p>
I wrote another post a while ago about using the shell to detect
who responded on a Google form. It looks like it didn't convert when
I moved to my current blogging platform - I'll repost that shortly.

Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/dougpete">Doug Peterson</a> wrote a "Whatever happened to" post subtitled
<a href="https://dougpete.wordpress.com/2016/05/08/whatever-happened-to-5/">HTML as an essential 21st Century skill?</a> It's a nice post.
</p>

<p>
I left a comment but thought I'd elaborate here.
</p>

<p>
No, knowing HTML is not programming - it's markup. Even so, when I
help people design CS programs, I'll frequently recommend starting
with HTML or at least introducing it early.
</p>

<p>
Why? 
</p>

<p>
It's a gateway and not just to programming.
</p>

<p>
HTML is pretty easy, you want <b><b>something</b></b> bold, you just wrap the
word in <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/b&gt;</code>:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;b&gt;something&lt;/b&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>
It's also empowering and demystifies the web. Kids can create a simple
web page and load it right into their browser.
</p>

<p>
It's true that today's web pages are chock-full-o javascript and css
but with just the basics, students can get the idea. You can also show
them pages by right clicking and viewing source.
</p>

<p>
You can even have them change a live page.
</p>

<p>
Try it. 
</p>

<p>
Right click on the top of this page where it says "Musings about…"
Chose <b><b>inspect element</b></b>. In the "debugger" window double click the
text, change it and hit enter. This is just temporary - just reload
the page but it's pretty neat for a kid to change an article and then
screenshot it.
</p>

<p>
HTML is also a nice stepping stone towards coding. You're working in a
plain text editor by adding special code words to basic text which are
then interpreted by, in this case, the web browser.
</p>

<p>
The big reason for teaching html actually goes beyond this. Next step
after learning HTML is having the kids programatically generating web
pages in whatever language you're using for the class. I like using
Python. This requires a little infrastructure setup to serve kids work
but then there are two huge wins.
</p>

<p>
First, as the kids learn programming, instead of just printing out
results, they can make a web site with their results and share it with
friends, family, and the world.
</p>

<p>
The other big bonus is that kids might be able to leverage take these
skills to other classes. If the student has a history paper to write,
maybe the teacher will accept a history web site where the student can
write code to do their analytics and build nice looking tables and
graphs with results.
</p>

<p>
So while knowledge of HTML in and of itself isn't really needed
anymore it's still an important part of the programs I build.

Some good points in the Facebook comments on my <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/ap-we-dont-trust-teachers/#.Vy5aAd9vH0o">last post</a>. One notable
comment was the fact that many teachers wouldn't be able to gain the
traction needed to teach CS without an AP designation. This is true
but also sad that we've awarded such educational authority to a
private company that's accountable to no one. Schools should run
courses because they're good for kids not specifically because they're
AP.
</p>

<p>
Stuyvesant just implemented a policy that every student has to take at
least one AP class to graduate and that now every student in an AP
class has to take the AP exam. There's also been a push for Stuy to
run APCS Principles in spite of the fact that the current home grown
intro course is superior.  
</p>

<p>
These policies and pushes at Stuy are purely for the sake of ratings
and in no way for the benefit of the student.
</p>

<p>
But let's imagine a world without the college board.  To do this we're
going to have to take off our computer science hats and look at
another, more established high school subject area - mathematics.
</p>

<p>
First, setting the stage.
</p>

<p>
It's the mid 1990's. High school students across the nation are taking
math classes. Some are even taking calculus. This makes the College
Board happy since they offer two AP Calculus exams. But the College
Board notices that many students aren't ready for calculus. To fill
this gap, they create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Statistics">AP Statistics</a>. First offered in 1997 to 7,667
students it was given to almost 200,000 students last year.
</p>

<p>
According to wikipedia, the course was created to give an AP
mathematics option for students not ready for calculus. 
</p>

<p>
I don't seem to recall any huge demand for an AP statistics course but
it was created and adopted. It turned into one of the fastest growing
AP classes and a nice money maker for the college board. I don't know
how the class was pushed or perceived in other schools but at Stuy it
was seen as a way to get an easy AP math course on the
transcript. Before any statisticians get the torches and pitchforks -
I'm just relaying the student perception. I haven't looked into the
course sufficiently to form an opinion on it.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's imagine a world without the College Board.
</p>

<p>
An individual school would look at it's students needs and decide if
they needed an additional math course. Maybe they'd conclude that what they
were doing was fine or maybe they would conclude that a new class was
needed. 
</p>

<p>
If they decided they needed a new advanced course the school would
either have the expertise to create it in house or they'd probably
turn to the local college or university for guidance.
</p>

<p>
They might end up with a course very similar to AP Statistics or they
might end up with something very different. They might
end up with another class like Discrete Math or they might end up
partnering with the college and having students take classes there. In
all cases, since math teachers generally have a pretty good math
backgroud, schools could make good decisions and design sound
educational experiences for their kids.
</p>

<p>
All of these seem to be better results for the students than blindly
following the College Board - keeping
education and education decisions local.
</p>

<p>
What about CS?
</p>

<p>
I admit that's a tougher nut to crack.
</p>

<p>
Most schools generally don't currently have the in house expertise
needed to build their own solutions or even to really critically judge
what's out there. 
</p>

<p>
That said, even if you need join the cult of the College Board to get
your school to run some CS you can:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Grab all the materials you can find - those labeled AP and those not
labeled AP.</li>
<li>Don't bother with AP Syllabus certification. Teach what you think is
best. Designate the class as honors to differentiate them from other
classes.</li>
<li>Engage with your local college and tech sector. They're not high
school educators but they are valuable resources.</li>
<li>Unrelated side note - be wary of code schools - most don't really
have any educational chops.</li>
<li>Don't force kids to sit for the exams and only encourage them to do
so if the exam will likely do something for the kid.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think that's it or my College Board rants.
</p>

<p>
Then again, I also thought that when I wrote Friday's post.

<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/college-board/">Yesterday</a>, I ranted on about the College Board. This led to a Facebook
hosted discussion which got me thinking a little more:
</p>

<p>
Advanced Placement exams basically exist because we don't trust our
high school teachers. 
</p>

<p>
I usually use phrases like "society doesn't trust" but let's
personalize it this time – for parents, think about whether or not you trust your
kids teachers? Do you a large private, unaccountable organization
more?
</p>

<p>
If you teach an advanced placement course, in order for your class to
be listed as AP you have to submit your syllabus to the college board
for approval. This sounds like they're setting a standard but it's
not. I can point to a bunch of teachers who have submitted identical syllabi
where sometimes it's accepted but ofttimes it's rejected. This is the
syllabus we submitted originally for Stuy. Yes, we have high achieving
kids, but given the fact that the syllabus was approved originally and
that Stuy students just about all score 4 or 5 on APCS-A should tell
you something about the level of care or competence of the College
Board.
</p>

<p>
Then you teach the class and in May, one to two months before the end
of the semester the kids take the AP exam - you don't see results
until the summer.
</p>

<p>
In theory, if the kids do well they can receive placement or
credit. The problem is, fewer and fewer schools are giving credit,
when they do, it might not help due to the way undergrads pay for
courses and placement can generally be achieved by appealing to
college departments or by taking college administered placements.
</p>

<p>
Back to the trust thing.
</p>

<p>
In college, you take a course, the final exam is created by the
professor or a group of professors and it's graded by the people that
teach the course - possibly as a committee. Kids final grades include
these exams but a student can fail a final or even miss one and still
pass the class whereas an AP exam is a one shot deal and even if you
"pass" you might not get anything from it. I'm not even getting into
questioning the quality and content of the exams. 
</p>

<p>
Kids get their grades and college credit. There are no outside
"standardized exams" and we trust that the professors and the colleges
are educating our kids. 
</p>

<p>
Now, in high school, teachers make their lessons, teach their classes,
create, administer, and grade final exams and kids get grade - but not
for college level classes.
</p>

<p>
I know multiple high school physics, chemistry, math, and computer
science teachers who are far better at teaching than their college
counterparts yet my friend the math teacher isn't trusted to assess
his calculus students for the purpose of college credit - we don't
trust him but we trust the faceless entity known as the College
Board. 
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
Think about that for a minute.
</p>

<p>
You trust your child's teacher with your child's well being every
day but you don't trust him to say whether or not your kid knows
calculus?
</p>

<p>
This is a real problem.
</p>

<p>
I have a friend who frequently doesn't quite finish the BC Calculus
test topics because he actually teaches the material in depth –
instead of "follow the scripts" the kids go through proofs and
derivations. It costs the kids - I know a number of them who got a 4
on the BC exam rather than a 5 but come the end of June when the class
is done, they know more calculus more deeply than a lot of kids who've
taken the class in college. 
</p>

<p>
The lines of college have been blurred with more and more "remedial"
classes being taught at the college level and more and more "college
level" being taught in the high schools.
</p>

<p>
It's a really sad state of affairs when we trust our professors - many
of whom are hired more for research than for their teaching chops
and we don't trust our teachers during our kids more formative years.

    <p>
It's important to remember, the college board is about making money
for the college board. It's not about supporting teachers and it's
certainly  not about educating kids.
</p>


<p>
Kids took the AP Computer Science A exam last week and the College
Board just released the free response questions. There seems to me
more chatter about them in social media than in past years.
</p>

<p>
I'm just left wondering how AP became the be all and end all.
</p>

<p>
From where I stand, the College Board, who runs AP, SAT, and PSAT
exams is all about making money for the College Board - they're a
non-profit in name only.
</p>

<p>
It's all about market share and dominance.
</p>

<p>
Looking at APCS A, it's not a great exam or course. At Stuy, I taught
a super-set of the old AB and pretty much ignored the parts I didn't
like (that is, the case study) but many schools can't do that. In my
case, most of the schools my kids went to didn't award credit, even
for a 5. They did sometimes award placement but I've had just as many,
if not more kids gain placement just by showing their work to the CS
department at their chosen school.
</p>

<p>
Now they're rolling out APCS Principles. I do get the fact that many
schools don't have people to roll their own courses, but I'm not
overly impressed by much of what's come out. I think what we've
developed is stronger and time proven.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, and moving beyond just CS, the College Board has somehow
bamboozled the public to think AP = Good. Colleges are awarding less
and less credit but everyone's telling the kids to take more and more
AP classes. What's worse, somehow US News and World Report magically
became an authority on school ratings and now the more AP classes your
kids take the better.
</p>

<p>
I know of at least one school with a highly lauded principal boast
about all his kids came in behind in math and by their senior year
passed honors calculus. Looking at the data unfortunately showed that
while all his seniors took the class, all failed, scoring below
a 3. It made the school look great but I'd argue that it was child
abuse.
</p>

<p>
The principal of course parlayed that gig to an even higher profile
one.
</p>

<p>
Now, you could just file the stupid paperwork so that you can run
classes labeled as AP and have kids take the classes but not the exam
but the College Board's working on that - there are rumblings in NY
on using <a href="http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/ny/2016/04/13/new-york-considering-using-scores-on-ap-exams-and-sat-subject-tests-in-teacher-evaluations/#.VyyRlN9vGAk">student AP scores in teacher ratings</a>. Using student test
results for teacher ratings is already a bad idea - using AP is even
worse.
</p>

<p>
Of course, to really get the cash cow going, AP is entering deals with
agencies and municipalities for large scale testing – in NY students will have to take the
SAT and <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/nyc-will-give-free-sat-testing-to-hs-juniors.html">take it for free</a>. Then there's code.org's deal free PD for
school's that have their kids take <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-05-19-code-org-college-board.html/">yet another meaningless exam</a>, the
new PSAT/8-9.
</p>

<p>
Of course, none of this is free - it's our taxpayer money hard at work
being shuttled right into the college board.
</p>

<p>
What are we getting? Tests that they create and control and are
EXTREMELY secretive about that don't tell us anyhting that we don't
already know about our kids. Oh, and teachers lose instructional time
and have to <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2015-10-13-psat.html/#.VyzHNN9vGAk">proctor</a> these exams instead of teaching.
</p>

<p>
Great deal if you can get it.
</p>

<p>
Now, what's the value of this – more meaningless tests for the
kids. I don't know if there's a record of this anywhere but in the
pre-internet day, I remember watching a news report where a College
Board representative stated that the SAT was a valid predictor of one
thing - how students would do on future SAT exams.
</p>

<p>
So, were left with more money flowing to an outside company with
students taking more meaningless tests.
</p>

<p>
I wish more schools showed the backbone that Fieldston, an elite
private school in NY had when it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/01/nyregion/high-school-drops-its-ap-courses-and-colleges-don-t-seem-to-mind.html">dropped A.P. courses</a> over 10 years
ago. They still seem to be well regarded as a school and their kids do
just fine in terms of college acceptance.
