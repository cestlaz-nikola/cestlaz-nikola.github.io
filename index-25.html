Org mode has an amazing feature - <b><b>org-capture</b></b>. I only started
using it recently but it's really awesome. 
</p>

<p>
What took me so long?
</p>

<p>
Probably that the manual seemed a little intimidating. 
</p>

<p>
It really isn't hard, though. Combined with what I'll go over in the
next video and post (and a future one for Google calendar sync) it's
what I use for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>recording blog ideas</li>
<li>managing bookmarks</li>
<li>taking short Notes</li>
<li>managing my calendar.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I use the binding:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">kbd</span> <span class="s">"C-c c"</span><span class="p">)</span>
       <span class="ss">'org-capture</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
By default, running org-capture brings up a form to capture a "task"
but things get really cool when you start making your own capture
templates. With capture templates, you can speed up recording
information and then tell org-mode to store it where you want it.
</p>

<p>
Here are my template settings. 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-capture-templates</span>

</pre></div>

<p>
Let's look at the <b><b>Blog</b></b> entry:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"b"</span> <span class="s">"Blog idea"</span> <span class="nv">entry</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">file+headline</span> <span class="s">"~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org"</span> <span class="s">"Blog Topics:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
 <span class="s">"* %?\n%T"</span> <span class="nv">:prepend</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>
It's a list with a bunch of options. The first string <b><b>b</b></b> is the
key to type to select this template, <b><b>Blog idea</b></b> is the actual name
for this template. 
</p>

<p>
The next item, <b><b>entry</b></b> describes the type of template you're
creating. <b><b>entry</b></b> says you're going to create an org node with a
headline which can then be added to an org-file. You can also have
your template create things like an org list <b><b>item</b></b> a checkbox
<b><b>checkitem</b></b> or even <b><b>plain</b></b> text. You can see the full set of
options <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Template-elements.html#Template-elements">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Next, in parentheses, you have the target - where to store the captured
info. The <b><b>Blog idea</b></b> template says <b><b>file+headline</b></b> followed by a
filename in quotes and a headline in quotes. This says to store the
new org heading you're capturing in the file
"~/Dropbox/orgfiles/i.org" under the heading "Blog Topics:" Contrast
this to the <b><b>appointments</b></b> template which just specifies <b><b>file</b></b>
and a filename. The <b><b>appointments</b></b> template will just append the new
appointment to its specified file whereas <b><b>Blog idea</b></b> will prepend
(due to the <b><b>:prepend</b></b> option at the end of the template) to the
"Blog Topics:" heading in <b><b>i.org</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
After this we have the actual template: "* %?\n%T" - the %? and %T are
placeholders for substitutions. The <b><b>%T</b></b> prompts for a date with a
timestamp and the <b><b>%?</b></b> is where to leave the cursor for final input
before saving the capture.
</p>

<p>
Finally, <b><b>:prepend</b></b> and other options can be found at the above link.
</p>

<p>
All the substitutions can be found in <a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion">the docs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once you've set up your templates, it's quick and easy to capture
information. 
</p>

<p>
This video shows the basics. The next one shows how to pop up a
capture even when you're not in emacs and how I use org-capture to
maintain my web bookmarks.

<p>
I haven't spoken much about the class I've been teaching this
semester. It's an intro CS course - a programming heavy intro. I
decided to use Python with a transition at the end to C++. The
transition is to mirror Hunter's normal first CS course that ends with
a C++ intro to prepare the students for next semester's CS course
which is a more intense OOP class using C++ - the language we use in
our core courses.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the semester I've tried to use a variety of interesting
application areas so as to try to give the students some idea of the
possibilities that studying CS will open up for them.
</p>

<p>
After covering Python dictionaries and lists I thought we'd play by
building an inverted Index.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is to map a set of words back to source files. For
example, given the following four one line files:
</p>


<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">files</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"> </th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"> </th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">contents</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">file.01</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">if you prick us do we not bleed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">file.02</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">if you tickle us do we not laugh</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">file.03</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">if you poison us do we not die and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">file.04</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">if you wrong us shall we not revenge</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
You could build a data structure mapping each word back to the file(s)
that contain it (partially shown here),
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<colgroup>
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
<col class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Word</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left"> </th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Files containing It's</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">if</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">you</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">prick</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">file.01</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">us</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">file.01 file.02 file.03 file.04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">do</td>
<td class="org-left"> </td>
<td class="org-left">file.01 file.02 file.03</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
You can, of course, store more information - how many times a word
appears in a file, where it appears, etc.
</p>

<p>
This is a fairly easy structure to build. A dictionary where the keys
are the words in the file and the values are lists of the documents
containing the words.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="n">inverted_index</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="s1">'if'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file.01'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.02'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.03'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.04'</span><span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s1">'you'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file.01'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.02'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.03'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.04'</span><span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s1">'prick'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file.01'</span><span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s1">'us'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file.01'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.02'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.03'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.04'</span><span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="s1">'do'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file.01'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.02'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'file.03'</span><span class="p">],</span>
      <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In addition to letting us work with dictionaries and lists, we can
also review file access and even the python CSV module if we want.
</p>

<p>
We can immediately write simple queries – "what document(s) contain
the word 'prick,' but things get more interesting if you write
functions to perform <b><b>and</b></b> and <b><b>or</b></b> queries - "what document(s)
contain the words 'prick' <b><b>or</b></b> 'do'" for instance.
</p>

<p>
Why are we building this (besides as a data structure and programming
exercise)? I've seen a number of references to using an inverted index
when building a web search engine. In fact, I think that's something
you do early on in the Udacity Mooc. I just wanted to play with
information retrieval.
</p>

<p>
I remembered that there was a collection of information, including
last statements from <a href="https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html">executed offenders in Texas</a>. Someone conveniently
converted it into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAjZTtPriClY-X3n9whTkA4i5D7bn3bmtHnLoaVICvI/edit#gid=1">Google Spreadsheet</a>. The format's a little
different from our simple four file example but then there's more
data. It's straightforward enough to download the spreadsheet as a CSV
file and then read it with a Python program that builds it into an
inverted index.
</p>

<p>
Now we have some interesting data to play with.
</p>

<p>
How many offenders used words like "sorry" or "apologize?" How about
references to religion? We can do all sorts of <b><b>and</b></b> and <b><b>or</b></b>
queries. 
</p>

<p>
We just played with this a bit but I could see all sorts of
explorations. What about taking some great work of literature and
turning it into an inverted index by chapter. You could query
characters or certain words and see where and when they appear in the
book. A new and different way of exploring literature.
</p>

<p>
So, there you have it - an interesting little project we played with
this past semester. We did it in an intro Python course but I could
see it as an interesting project in AP CS A using hashmaps and lists.

This old article has been reposted a few times in my circles over the
past few weeks <a href="http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/">http://educationnext.org/facadeofexcellence/</a>. It's from
2003 and complains about the lack of flexibility schools had back then
with regard to hiring and salary. The article is old and out of date
and the seniority system no longer holds for hiring but it does for
lay offs. The salary scale from back then, though, is still in place. 
</p>

<p>
My friend Alex  asked my thought about how we might deal with evaluating
teacher quality. I thought I'd share them here.
</p>

<p>
Alex listed a number of commonly tried and suggested options on
teacher evaluation and why they're all flawed. 
</p>

<p>
I haven't asked Alex's permission so I won't post his list and
comments here. Instead let's start with the boogeyman those that attack public
education always trot out – tenure.
</p>

<p>
Let's get a couple of things straight - tenure is not a job for
life. For K12 teachers, it's the right to due process. That means you
can't be fired without cause. 
</p>

<p>
I hear the free market capitalists out there already – "in the real
world, you're an at will employee, why do teachers need this due
process?" - I'll get to that down below. For now, let's look at a few
points on tenure:
</p>

<p>
First - you can fire a tenured teacher, you just have to document your
case. This means that the supervisor has to actually do their job.
</p>

<p>
Next - people can complain about rubber rooms and the time it takes to
fire one of these tenured teachers. That's because the DOE won't hire
sufficient hearing officers. In a recently resolved case, a friend of
mine - a terrific AP was finally returned to her post after she was
railroaded on false charges. She was in the rubber room for years. The
DOE kept delaying the process – all she wanted was to go to "trial"
since everyone knew she'd be exonerated - the fact that she was up on
charges at all speaks to why teachers need tenure.
</p>

<p>
Next - teachers don't grant tenure, the administration does. Why are
all these horrible teachers being granted tenure? Stories abound of
administrators granting tenure to bad teachers so long as they
transfer to another school - who's to blame here? 
</p>

<p>
Finally, the contract that establishes tenure is jointly negotiated
by the teachers union and the city - no one ever seems to complain
about the city.
</p>

<p>
Next, let's talk about bonuses and competition. People in the business
world take the false assumption that everyone thinks, acts, and feels like
they do. Here's a surprising fact – teachers aren't in it for the
money. Sure, we'd like to make a little more - perhaps enough to
actually  live in a decent apartment and not need a second job to make
ends meet -  but no one went into teaching to get rich. Teachers are in
it to uplift ALL their students and their school as a whole. 
</p>

<p>
Now let's look at the model currently in vogue - value added
measures. Besides the fact that they're arbitrary and don't work (see
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-09-06-why_i_might_no_longer_be_an_effective_teacher.md/">this post</a> and <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2013-10-25-effective-teacher-2.md/">this one</a>) they're nothing like how people are evaluated
in the real world.
</p>

<p>
How are people evaluated in regular jobs? As far as I know, they're
evaluated by their managers and bosses - possibly also by their peers.
</p>

<p>
Funny thing - that's how teachers used to be evaluated before all this
nonsense brought about by the "reformers." Of course, no one will
admit to this. 
</p>

<p>
Did this system work? For the most part, but not entirely. Why were
there problems? Because, unlike a business, principals are not
necessarily incentivized to have the best teachers. 
</p>

<p>
Schools and principals are evaluated on ridiculous metrics - the same
standardized tests they use to evaluate teachers. To look at a small
piece – to graduate high school, kids need to pass at least one math
regents and pass three years of math classes. To be "college ready" a
student still only needs to pass one math regents and take at least
one year of geometry or trig.
</p>

<p>
This means that as far as math is concerned, a principal is
incentivized to have a math department that can get their kids through
the algebra regents. Here's how this frequently plays out. The kids
take algebra over two years and then passes the exam. The kids take
geometry as their third year. They don't have to pass the regents, but
it appears that in order to increase a student's chances of passing
that exam, classes don't teach proof - the most important and hardest
part of the class. Why not? Because it's easier to pass the exam by
learning most of the other stuff.
</p>

<p>
Here we have a school where the incentive is to hire teachers that can
teach to the algebra regents and that's about it.
</p>

<p>
That's at a school with a low performing population. In a higher
performing school, the kids will do well on the standardized tests
regardless of teacher quality so there's no incentive to hire the
best. Even if that's what they want to do, there's no way to know if
they're actually doing it.
</p>

<p>
Back to why teachers need due process. Since principals aren't held
accountable in any reasonable way, teachers can't be. The end result
is that teachers are subject to abuses by principals. I myself was
once brought up on bogus charges raised by a principal (not a Stuy
one) who wanted to make trouble. Without due process, I would be out
of a job. So would many others.
</p>

<p>
The answer? To me it's figure out how to hold principals
accountable. In Alex's Facebook post he  mentions evaluation by
college and workforce success but that has a slow feedback loop. The
truth is, education does have a slow feedback loop. Schools, however,
exist for along time and principals should have tenure periods of more than
just a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
My feelings? Why not look at graduates succeeding in college or on the
tax rolls? This wouldn't be perfect but it would be a start. While NY
can't count on private universities sharing accurate information in a
timely manner there should be a way of tracking if a high school
graduate is enrolled in a SUNY or CUNY one, two, three, or four
semesters after graduation. Create a baseline for a school and start
from there. 
</p>

<p>
If principals were actually accountable in a reasonable
way they'd have incentive to have the best teachers. Then we can get
back to the old system which was indeed the way the "real world"
works.

Quick post today. 
</p>

<p>
The video goes over web-mode - my preferred weapon for html and all the goodies you embed in an html file.
</p>

<p>
It's multi-modal so it acts sensibly regardless of wether you're editing html, css, javascript or even templates in a single file.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Note:</b></b> In the video, web-mode wasn't automatically inserting
quotes. I had to set hte following variable to fix this:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(setq web-mode-enable-auto-quoting t)
</pre></div>


<p>
Giving the final configuration I'm currently using: 
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">web-mode</span>

Another quick hit today.
</p>

<p>
This video is really setting the stage for hte next two, where I talk about org-mode capturing.
</p>

<p>
Today, we're demoing the use of the emacs server and client.
</p>

<p>
Back in the old days, emacs took a LOOONG time to load. A complex
conviguration could take on the order of 10 to 20 seconds. This
resulted in people loading emacs at the start of the day and leaving
it up forever. While load times aren't much of an issue anymore, it's
still nice to leave emacs around all the time.
</p>

<p>
That's where running emacs as a server comes in.. I set up a keyboard shortcut my window manager to run:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>emacsclient -a <span class="s2">""</span> -c
</pre></div>

<p>
Rather than trying to run emacs, this tries to connect to an already
running emacs server. The <b><b>-c</b></b> creates a new frame. Instead if you
use <b><b>-t</b></b> it will open emacs in the terminal. The <b><b>-a ""</b></b> tells
emacs to run itself as a server (daemon) if it isn't already running.
</p>


<p>
Later on, running <b><b>emacsclient -c</b></b> will very quickly bring up a new frame to the server.
</p>

<p>
In addition to instant loading, Running emacs this way has the
advantage, or some may say disadvantage of keeping buffers around
forever since you just keep emacs up and running.

Today's video is a bit of a follow up on the last one as well as a few
miscillaneous configuration.
</p>

<p>
We got some comments on alternate ways to load a file if it exists -
it's always cool to see how different people end up doing similar things.
</p>

<p>
We then talk about three little configurations. Two I found out about
reading Jon Sander's (jcs) blog <a href="http://irreal.org/blog">Irreal</a>. Jon's blog is a terrific
source of emacs info - if you don't subscribe, you should.
</p>

<p>
I go over using counsel for working with the kill-ring. The command
counsel-yank-pop acts as a replamcement for yank-pop and it lets you
easily yank anything from the kill ring - not just the most previously
killed/whacked piece. 
</p>

<p>
You just hit <b><b>M-y</b></b> and then either keep hitting it or use up and
down to select what you want to yank. 
</p>

<p>
Here's the original post from Irreal: <a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707">http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5707</a>.
</p>

<p>
I then briefly talk about smoothing things over between the system
clipboard and the kill ring, also from Irreal:
<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5702">http://irreal.org/blog/?p=5702</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I talk about auto-revert-mode - this monitors files on your
file system and when they change, they reload your buffer. I find this
very useful to keep multiple machines in sync when I'm working with
files in a could based filesystem like Dropbox or Owncloud.

Over on Facebook, my Alma Mater and long time employer, Stuyvesant
High School seems to be making a big push to up it's Regeneron Science
Talent Search game. For those of you who aren't familiar, that's the
latest incarnation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneron_Science_Talent_Search">the Westinghouse Science Talent Search</a> from
back in my day.
</p>

<p>
It seems that Stuyvesant hasn't had that many semi finalists,
finalists, and winners over the past few years and isn't happy about
it. The result is a bunch of social media reminding us of old winners
and trying to raise funds to get us back to the glory days.
</p>

<p>
I'd rather they spent there time, energy, and money elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
When I was a young teacher, I was enamored with those types of
results. When my kids did well on a USACO competition, for example, I
felt pretty good about myself.
</p>

<p>
Then one day, I had an epiphany. I was looking over the results of a
big USACO competition. My kids came in 4th, 5th, and I think
fifteenth. I was feeling pretty good about myself but then I realized
that Dan, Evan, and Jon - my three top scorers would probably have
done just fine without me. Sure, I do believe that I was able to help
them in their growth as both computer scientists and as people but
they were already off the charts smart. 
</p>

<p>
The same is true about the Science Talent Search (STS) winners. A
friend of mine ran Stuyvesant's math research class for a number of
years. He had a pretty impressive string of finalists and winners. How
did he do it? 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Identify Stuyvesant's top talent - the ones already most likely to
succeed in the STS.</li>
<li>Pawn them off on a lab or professor.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Stuy class, by and large, did little or nothing for these kids yet
we would hold them up as shining examples of how wonderful we were.
</p>

<p>
When I had my epiphany, I started designing my intro class and
focusing my efforts on the whole school population. The results?
Scores of people succeeding in tech who never would have considered it
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
While my super high achievers have indeed gone  on to successful lives
and careers, some of my most successful graduates, by any number of
measures have been the students who would otherwise have gotten lost
in the crowd at Stuy.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, many of Stuyvesant's STS winners would have been STS
winners regardless of where they went. We may or may not have helped
them along the way but STS results are not the measure of a great
school.
</p>

<p>
Improving a school, any school, for all its students might not help in
those bogus national ratings but that really should be what we're
about.

Some of the videos I want to make are going to be much easier to do if
I'm working in my own account where my whole file tree is available. 
</p>

<p>
It's also a little annoying changing between my full emacs config and
the one I'm developing here.
</p>

<p>
So, I decided to move to this config for my real config and as I make
more videos move parts of my old configuration over to this new one.
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that I <b><b>need</b></b> some of my current config right
now – things like my email setup.
</p>

<p>
This video talks about how I'm going to set things up to take care of
everything.

This post points to the next three videos in the Flask series.
</p>

<p>
The first covers setting up a droplet (virtual server) on
<a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>. The second, deploying a flask application using <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green
Unicorn</a>, and the third, using <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">sshfs</a> to remotely mount your files from
your DO box to your local machine and how to set up DNS using <a href="http://freedns.afraid.org">FreeDNS</a>.

I meant to cover these last time but decided not to so as to keep the
videos to about 10 minutes each.
</p>

<p>
First up this time round is <a href="https://github.com/victorhge/iedit">iedit</a> - a really cool mode that lets you
select all the instances of the marked selection at the same time and
edit them all at once. By default it's bound to <b><b>C-l</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
For example, let's say you had the following code:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">somevar</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">somevar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">somevar</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">somevar</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You could mark one instance of <b><b>somevar</b></b>, hit <b><b>C-;</b></b> and you'd be
editing them all at once. When you're done, you hit <b><b>C-;</b></b> again and
everything is un-selected.
</p>

<p>
There are other ways to modify multiple instances of a selection. You
can always search and replace or use Magnar Sveen's really cool
<a href="https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el">multiple cursors</a> package and I'm sure there are others but I like
iedit since it's small and simple. It also works for rectangular
editing but I didn't cover that in the video. I'll probably demo it
when I cover rectangular editing in general.
</p>

<p>
Iedit has limitations. For insance, since it works globally, it isn't
perfect for renaming variables. If the above code snippet was part of
a larger program with many other instances of <b><b>somevar</b></b>, iedit
wouldn't, by itself, be as useful.
</p>

<p>
You could reach for a language specific refactoring package but for
me, that's where <b><b>narrowing</b></b> comes in. You can mark a region and
tell emcas to <b><b>narrow-to-region</b></b> which hides everything outside the
region and temporarily (until you <b><b>widen</b></b>) treats the region as the
whole document. 
</p>

<p>
So, you could narrow to the section of code you want to edit and then
use iedit from within.
</p>

<p>
To make things easier, I grabed <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/emacs-narrow-or-widen-dwim.html">narrow-or-winden-dwim</a> from <a href="http://endlessparentheses.com/">Endless
Parentheses</a>.
</p>

<p>
I think the video makes the behaviour pretty clear.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy
