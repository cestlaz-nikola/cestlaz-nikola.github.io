I've been having fun with this years <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> competition. So
far, I've been able to keep up but with I expect that to change in
another couple of days since I'll be traveling for the weekend.
</p>

<p>
After solving a problem, I like looking over some of the other
solutions on the Advent of Code <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/">subreddit</a>. Even with similar
agorithmic solutions there's a decent amount of variation in the
actual code and solutions in different languages can look radically
different.
</p>

<p>
That got me thinking about how the tools we know and use both shape the ways we
approach solving problems and creating things and either limit or
empower us to go from a mental model of a solution or creation to an
actual artifact. 
</p>

<p>
Relating to this are the common themes that come up in the CS
Education world. The idea that it's computer science not programming
and certainly not merely coding. That's true but the tools and
languages we use shape the whole thinking part and can also give the
students a valuable practical tool that they can leverage to great
advantage in both future classes and work and life endeavors.

I decided to do this rant as a video. I hope you enjoy it:

Yesterday I was one of the judges at <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">StuyHacks</a>. A one day hackathon at
Stuyvesant run by and organized by the students. I don't have attendee
stats but there were kids from all over the city and at least one team
from New Jersey. The youngest student that I met was in sixth grade
and the oldest were high school seniors. The judging was at the end
but I decided to stop by earlier to see how the hackers were doing.
</p>

<p>
There was an incredible variety of projects using a wide array of
tools. There were projects built with:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Java</li>
<li>Processing</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Scratch</li>
<li>A-Frame</li>
<li>Python / Flask</li>
<li>HTML/CSS/JS</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>
A personal highlight for me was running into Sophie - the daughter of
two of my students from #Stuy95. Well, both a highlight and a reminder
that I'm getting old.
</p>

<p>
The StuyHacks team did a terrific job running things and at the end I
told them I'd love to help with future events.
</p>

<p>
I did notice a couple of things at the hackathon that echo things I've
learned as a teacher over the years and I thought they were worth
sharing.
</p>

<p>
The first was the a number of the beginner groups needed more
direction. This didn't seem to be related to grade level or age as
much as CS experience. This isn't a hackathon only issue. It exists in
all learning environments. If as teachers we're too prescriptive
students end up with a single formula to follow. Sure, that'll get
them through a standardized exam like APCS-A but too much of it can
hinder them in becoming creative problem solvers.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, not enough structure will leave many kids staring
at a blank page. I remember I gave a quiz years ago. It had one
problem: "You have 20 minutes to prove to me that you learned
something about the past unit on Cellular Autmata" or something like
that. Some kids absolutely loved it but many hated it. Stuy kids are
trained test takers. They're prepared for structure. This threw many
for a loop.
</p>

<p>
I noticed this issue with some of the hackers at StuyHacks. Some
beginners really had a hard time figuring out what they could do and
what they should do.
</p>

<p>
A hackathon isn't a classroom so I think the problem is pretty easily
remedied. Groups that were able to latch on to a good mentor seemed to
get the guidance they needed. A beginners hackathon should make sure
they have not only plenty of mentors but they should make sure that
the mentors are prepped with a number of project ideas in a number of
the standard beginner platforms. A hackathon could also provide an
assortment of ideas in a list.
</p>

<p>
The second thing I noticed was at the end of the day as I was
judging. It started with one particular group. They were pretty
apologetic about their project. Basically because it wasn't
finished. Personally, I thought what they accomplished in essentially
7 hours was pretty impressive. What became clear as we talked is that
this group was deathly afraid of failure. Their deepest fear at that
moment was that I was going to give them high marks and they might
have to show off their incomplete (yet rather impressive) project to a
room full of strangers. 
</p>

<p>
This fear of failure was prevalent in groups that ultimately didn't
submit their projects for judging and it seemed to be common among
students from high performing, high expectation schools where
frequently one associates a test score or grade with ones value. I'm
not happy to say that Stuy has always had this problem.
</p>

<p>
This isn't really a problem that a hackathon can or should be able to
address. It's just something I noticed. It's a problem for schools and
also for a society that's test obsessed.
</p>

<p>
I hope nobody reads too much into these observations. The day was a
tremendous success. A whole bunch of kids had a great day working
together to build cool things with technology. Congratulations to the
StuyHacks team. They did a terrific job putting it all together. If
you're a middle or high school student or know one, keep an eye on the
StuyHacks <a href="http://stuyhacks.com/">web page</a> and make sure to attend their next event.

It's once again time for <a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. That one a day programming
competition that's been running now for three years.
</p>

<p>
Here are some thoughts on <a href="http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1">day 1</a>. The core of the problem is that you
have a large string of digits and you have to calculate a
checksum. This is done by adding the sum of a subset of the
digits. Only the ones that are identical to the digit to their
right. To make it a little more interesting, the last digit wraps
around to the first for checksum purposes.
</p>

<p>
For example, the input <b><b>2234335</b></b> leads to the calculate <code>2 + 3</code> or
<code>5</code>. The input <b><b>234445662</b></b> leads to <code>4+4+6+2</code> or <code>16</code>. We add 4 for
twice because the first four is adjacent the second and the second the
third. We add the 2 at the end because it wraps around to match the
one at the front.
</p>

<p>
We first read in the data and strip off the trailing newline
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">origdata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">origdata</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">origdata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">origdata</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then, since we can access the elements of the string as a list (or
array) it's a simple loop to calculate the sum:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
	<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1"># Don't forget to turn the string into an int</span>

<span class="c1"># data[-1] is the python way of getting the last element - here we check the wraparound</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Checksum: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Pretty straightforward but I don't like the special case of checking
the last element for the wraparound. Sometimes it's possible to get
rid of edge cases like this by <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-02-26-change-the-data.md">changing the data</a>. We can do that here
by simply appending a copy of the first character to the end of the
list.
</p>

<p>
This leads to a slightly cleaner solution:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">l</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]:</span>
	<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="c1">#don't forget to turn the string into an int</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Checksum: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
This is pretty much what I'd expect from a Python programmer that's
just starting out. We can use a couple of more advanced Python
features to make what I consider a more elegant solution.
</p>

<p>
Python's <b><b>zip</b></b> function takes two lists and interleaves them.
<code>zip("abc","def")</code> will yield <code>[ (a,d), (b,e), (c,f)]</code>. If the lists
are of different length, it just zips up until the shorter list is
exhausted. We can use array slicing to zip the input string with it's
neighbor by using <code>new_list = zip(data,data[1:])</code>. For the string "122344'
zipping gives us <code>[(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,4)]</code>. We can put this in
a list comprehension that only keeps the tuples representing an
element with an identical neighbor and also converts it to an int:
<code>new_list = [int(a) for a,b in new_list if a==b]</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we can just calculate the sum. This leads to the following
complete solution:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">checksum</span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">([</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">zip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:])</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">checksum</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
List comprehensions for the win!!!!
</p>

<p>
Each Advent of Code problem has two parts. You unlock the second by
solving the first. Here, the wrinkle is that instead of checking each
digit with it's neighbor to the right, you check it with the one
that's halfway around the list. 
</p>

<p>
With loops, the solution is just a quick modification of part 1. We
just add half the length and use mod to find the digit to compare with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"input.txt"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="n">l</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"part 2loop version: "</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>
I wanted to see if I could do this with a list comprehension
though. The trick was to figure out how to make two lists to zip

The insight was that we could just make a second list that starts
halfway through and then wraps around. I did this by adding
<code>data[l//2:] + data</code>. <code>l//2</code> is the integer division of the length (in
Python3). <code>data[l//2:]</code> represents the second half of data (from the
midway point to the end). Technically I should have only added the second
half of data: <code>data[l//2:] + data[:l//2]</code> where <code>data[:l//2]</code> gives us
the first half of the list but since zip will just stop when it
exhausts the shorter list, this wasn't necessary.
</p>

<p>
Day 2 also has a nice list comprehension based solution. Maybe I'll
write that up later.

A week or so ago I wrote about the event we had to kick off 
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/hunter-tech-kickoff">Hunter College's partnering with the NY tech community</a> to build a
Hunter to tech pipeline. Each table had two Hunter students and a
group of tech professionals. Each table discussed the Hunter CS
experience and how the tech community can help support the
students. Towards the end of the event a colleague commented that it
was a great idea to have the students essentially run the tables and
how effective it was. I didn't see any other way to do it. 
</p>

<p>
You have to trust the students. Put them in situations where they can
grow.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the event being a success overall, I think that for the
students it helped to break down barriers. These kids are soon to be
joining the tech community. They'll be interviewing for
internships and then jobs and the whole process can be rather
intimidating. By the end of the event the other week, there weren't
tables of students and professionals but rather tables of people all
having discussions on equal footing. It seems like a small thing. A
minor choice on how to run an event but it can have a subtle but
substantial impact in ways that are hard to see unless you look.
</p>

<p>
I was also reminded of this when reading Alfred Thompson's post on 
<a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/2017/11/how-some-schools-sabotage-computer.html">school tech management teams and CS teachers</a>. Alfred wrote about the
possible tension between the needs of CS teachers and the needs of the
rest of the school and the obligations of the people that actually set
up and maintain the technology in a school.
</p>

<p>
Years ago, at Stuy, I skirted the issue by taking on the
obligation of maintaining my own labs. This let me run Linux and
basically do whatever I felt we needed. It also meant my labs wouldn't
be set up for things like standardized testing. This came at a
price. I had to maintain it all myself. This is not to say that the
tech people haven't helped over the years. Some of them have been
terrific but other than swapping out bad machines it all fell on me.
</p>

<p>
Of course this wouldn't have been possible if it really all fell to
me. It only worked because I was able to enlist the aid of students
who wanted to learn about building and running a Linux network. Sure I
showed them some things but largely we <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-01-31-devops.html">figured it out
together</a>. Basically I trusted the kids with access and control and
gave them a safe place to learn and explore. 
</p>

<p>
It worked amazingly well. 
</p>

<p>
Of course there were plenty of headaches. There was the time when we
only had one AI/X server for the school and Jon somehow erased all the
shared libraries or the time when I think Paul or Ilya took away read
and execute access from all the system executables. I lost plenty of
sleep and pulled out much hair recovering from these messes and others
but I couldn't get too upset. They were learning, no one got hurt, and
truthfully they never committed any blunders worse than my own.
</p>

<p>
Giving up control to the kids can be nerve wracking at times but it's
worth it. It's why I always found coaching more stressful than
competing back when I fenced. You can do everything to prepare your
athletes but when they're out on the strip, there's nothing you can do
to help. It's all on them. On the other hand, I've always been more
gratified with my athletes or students successes than with my
own. There's something special about enabling others.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that we just turn our students loose.  We have to
set our students up to succeed. Set up the environment and the
circumstance and give the students the tools to work with. At the
event two weeks ago I knew that everyone in the room was a friend or
when I have students plan a hackathon and have them cold call a
company, maybe the company expects the call. There are all sorts of
things we can do behind the scenes to set out students up for success.
</p>

<p>
We set the stage and if we do it right, the kids won't
fail to impress.

Thanksgiving is reunion season. Stuyvesant and I'm guessing other high
schools traditionally hold their reunions, at least the five and ten
year ones over the holiday weekend. It makes sense since grads who've
moved away might still be coming to town for family celebrations.
</p>

<p>
This year, I was invited to the Stuy07 ten year reunion. I considered
crashing the Stuy97 20 year but it was at the same time and too far
away.
</p>

<p>
I'm always really flattered and honored when I get a reunion
invite. I've been to my share but I was never the hip popular teacher
that gets invited to these things. On the other hand, I'm sincere,
honest, and loyal so when I do connect with students it's meaningful
and lasting. As one of my students remarked when I was nominated to be
graduation speaker a few years ago and I doubted I would be elected
"hey, you lead the most popular cult in the school" and I guess in
some way the community is a cult, or as I'd rather say, a family. In
any event, whenever I'm invited to a reunion I make my best effort to
attend.
</p>

<p>
I find the role of faculty at reunions as somewhat amusing – we're
something of a prop. The grads are there and should be there to
reconnect with each other. The teachers are and should be secondary.
From my point of view, there are three groups of students. The ones
that are now part of my alumni family - now friends who I'm in touch
with to varying degrees, the ones that never knew me and the ones that
knew me a bit. For the second and third groups, as a faculty member,
I'm there to remind them of the glory days as a representative of the
institution.
</p>

<p>
As with all reunions I had plenty of "I was never in your class
but …" conversations. I also a number of "I majored in
fill-in-the-blank but just found my way back into tech
so….. thanks." I love these conversations - it gets someone
new into "the family." I also had one conversation that was really a
nice ego boost. One of my guys introduced me to his wife. She
immediately exclaimed "it's so great to finally meet you, he talks
about you all the time!" That was kind of weird until she went on
"…every time he talks about Stuy." That made more sense. It's like
all those times when me and my buddy Ben would reminisce about our
Junior High school days and we'd always get back to talking about
<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-05-09-my-favorite-year-teacher.html">Herb</a>, one of our best and favorite teachers and a major influence on
me while Devorah looked on confused. Eventually she met and got to
know Herb and it all made sense. Another grad added "you think we all
forget about you but you come up more than you know" so I take that as
a shout out to all of the teachers out there who never get to hear
back about how much they are remembered and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
With tools like email and Facebook it's easier to remain connected to
former students but it's always nice to connect in person. For the
StuyCS family, we have our periodic meetups but for the rest, I love
being included in class reunions and hope to be invited to more in
years to come.

The 38th installment of Using Emacs is about <b><b>dired</b></b>, Emacs' built
in mode for navigating and working with directories.
</p>

<p>
I'm not a dired power user and in fact am just now making a real
effort to explore it and work it into my daily workflow and
with that in mind, I'd love to hear some configuration and
use suggestions from people who use it regularly.
</p>

<p>
Here's the configuration I use:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">dired+</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'dired+</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
which merely adds dired+ into the mix.
</p>

<p>
I also started playing with <a href="https://github.com/joddie/pcre2el">pcre2el</a> which allows me to use the more
usual regex syntax in place of Emacs regex syntax in both dired and
other places. This is a big win for me since I never remember all the
escaping rules for Emacs regex.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">pcre2el</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
<span class="nv">:config</span> 
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">pcre-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
Finally, abo-abo and jcs have both written about new features in ,
Ivy/Swiper/Counsel that allow you to use ivy-occur to dump results
into a dired buffer (<a href="http://irreal.org/blog/?p=6760">link</a>, <a href="https://oremacs.com/2017/11/18/dired-occur/">link</a>) but to get that to work, I needed to
install <a href="https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep">wgrep</a> and also had to install and setup <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> which looks to be
useful.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">wgrep</span>
    <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">counsel-fzf-cmd</span> <span class="s">"/home/zamansky/.fzf/bin/fzf -f %s"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
To help get started here are links to a couple of cheat sheets:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/dired-ref.pdf">dired reference card</a></li>
<li><a href="https://harryrschwartz.com/assets/documents/dired-cheatsheet.pdf">another dired cheat sheet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
I'll probably use dired more frequently but again, would love to hear
how other people are using it.

<p>
Thks question was posed the other day - how can one get students to
truly understand the quicksort algorithm?
</p>

<p>
I've written a few posts about quicksort. The last time I did a <a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-12-select-to-sort.html/">lesson
writeup</a> on the subject I wrote about first looking and quickselect and
then moving to the quicksort. The class was first faced with the
problem of writing a routine to find the Kth smallest item in an
unsorted data set. The first solution was n<sup>2</sup> and then refined to a
quickselect. This led directly to the quicksort. 
</p>

<p>
I liked the lesson and I think it worked well when I taught it but
that was partly due to the overall tenor of that particular group of
students.
</p>

<p>
A similar approach develops the quicksort in a similar way but is
both more direct and accessible.
</p>

<p>
The motivating problem is to put one item in a data set in its proper
place. You could select one person in class and arrange the class so
that the selected student is in their proper size place, that is
everyone shorter on one side, taller on the other. You could also do
this for age. A similar exercise could be done with any number of
manipulatives.
</p>

<p>
This operation of arranging the rest of the set around one selected
item or person is very easy and in fact it's trivial to show that this
can be done in linear time. 
</p>

<p>
Once we've done this arrangement, we can discuss what we can infer
from this new arrangement. We can now tell that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>everyone to the left of the "pivot" is less than the pivot</li>
<li>everyone to the right is greater</li>
<li>The pivot element is at its true location if the list were
sorted. That is, if we started arranging around item k, then we've
moved item k to the kth location in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>
From here it's a small jump to the quicksort algorithm, just repeat
the process on the left and right data sets.
</p>

<p>
This approach not only makes the algorithm and its development clear
and simple but it also can be used to illustrate the worst case n<sup>2</sup>
behavior. 
</p>

<p>
The whole thing, minus the coding, can also be done as an unplugged activity.
</p>

<p>
In case anyone's interested, I also wrote a post on subtle
implementation errors when writing the quicksort (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2014-03-17-subtle-errors-sorting.html">here</a>) and also
looking at the qucksort from the point of view of different
programming paradigms (<a href="https://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2010-03-14-sorting-from-top-and-from-bottom.html">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
Enjoy.

<p>
One of my goals when I came over to Hunter was to help establish
Hunter CS as the place to be for CS in the city. Hunter already had a
solid CS program before I joined but it isn't well known. It also
doesn't have an established tech culture.
</p>

<p>
It's an ambitious goal but if it can be done, what a game changer. A
lot of people talk about equity, diversity, and social justice but if
we can establish Hunter as the place to be for CS in NY, what a
win. An affordable, accessible institution where you can get a great
CS education.
</p>

<p>
The truth of course is that I can't accomplish this - at least not by
myself. I'm just one person. Fortunately, there are so many wonderful
people in the New York Tech community that want to help bring
opportunities to the kids.
</p>

<p>
Last Thursday evening we got the ball rolling. Twenty five
representatives from the tech community got together at <a href="http://yext.om">Yext</a> with
about a dozen of our Hunter College CS students. The conversation
started with a discussion of perceptions of Hunter and the students
sharing what their experiences were like. By the end we were all
brainstorming as to how we can work together to best prepare Hunter
students to become members of the New York Tech community. 
</p>

<p>
I know the students left the evening energized and I did as well. I
hope our friends in Tech felt the same.

can merely get the people together who actually can. I'm grateful to
all my friends who are now a part of this and I'm looking forward to
working with  them, my students and my colleagues  to create 
a Hunter CS to Tech Community pipeline that's second to none.

Most mornings, I start my day with a workout. Sometimes I run,
sometimes I use my bike trainer. Dealing with plantar
fasciitis since last June, it's mostly been the bike. 
</p>

<p>
I occupy the time by either watching YouTube videos or catching up on
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/">Communications of the ACM</a> or <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a>. I'm about 6 months
behind on both.
</p>

<p>
Inspired by some talk in one of the CS Ed Facebook groups, I thought
I'd use the time to start going through some MOOCs. I started with
Udacity's Intro to Information Security. 
</p>

<p>
I'm only in lesson 4 but it's pretty light weight and generally well
presented but I keep seeing the same thing that pisses me off about
moocs. At the end of the day the video is just a lecture and what's
worse, a lecture with no feedback loop. 
</p>

<p>
Don't get me wrong, I love the fact that Udacity and the others have
their material up online and that I can get to it free of charge but I
don't love the fact there are people that still believe putting a computer
in front of a kid is better than a teacher.
</p>

<p>
I think this quiz question is pretty representative of what I'm
talking about. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
It's just a silly inline quiz question and not a particularly
important one but it pisses me off.
</p>

<p>
To start with, it uses the word  <b><b>could</b></b>  not <b><b>did</b></b>. That means
that every answer is correct. In fact an asnwer  choice like
"we're more secure because we have this really good engineer named
Stanley" could be given and would be a correct answer since  the
vendor <b><b>could</b></b> base their claim on Stanley's awesomness, it would
just be a bad idea. Unless you remember the specific ad campaign, you won't
know the answer  and even if you did, internally, they could use any
justification they want.
</p>

<p>
It reminds me of when my brother was in grade school and he had a test
question of:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Can you name all 50 states in the United States of America?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My brother's answer was "no." He was correct. I don't remember if the
teacher agreed.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, I'm just watching the videos and it's possible that the
readings clarified the question but even so, this is a very bad
question.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it's just a silly quiz but it is indicative of the problem with
any online learning resource and I and I'm sure others find it
frustrating. 
</p>

<p>
I don't want to come down hard on the lecturer or whomever made the
quiz question. In a class I might ask a question poorly but I have an
immediate feedback loop and can fix things right then and
there. Frustration doesn't build and in the case of holes in  important
conceptual material deficiencies don't develop.
</p>

<p>
I also don't want to come down on free resources that I use and
benefit from.
</p>

<p>
These types of issues seem small and the autodidacts that succeed in
using MOOCS work around them but if you look at these materials
critically as a teacher it's plain to see that their no substitute for
the real thing.

<p>
Today was Election Day. One of the few days each year when students
stay home and teachers spend all day attending what is generously
known as professional development.
</p>

<p>
Years ago I was in a room with a few colleagues when my friend Dave -
one of the best math teachers I know said "you know, every time we
have a PD day in NJ and my wife and I have to scramble to take care of
the kids I get a little annoyed but then think I shouldn't get annoyed
since they're spending the day doing all sorts of valuable PD." He
then said "but then I realize that their PD is probably about as
useful as our PD and I get really angry."
</p>

<p>
There you have it. This is not to say that there is no good PD but it
seems that the professional development opportunities provided by our
schools have over the years ranged from useless to insulting with
maybe a small bright spot here and there. Historically it's been worse
for CS teachers because we get lumped in with math teachers and have
to spend the day learning about tools and techniques we'll never use
or discussing curricula we never teach.
</p>

<p>
So, when I spoke to JonAlf about rescuing the Stuy teachers for the
day and hosting them at Hunter, he and the other CS teachers were
pretty excited. It wasn't as though I had the magic PD answer but I
was going to provide a space and we'd figure out together what would
be productive and valuable for them.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, I've been spending a good amount of time these past
few weeks visiting high schools to talk about Hunter CS and when I was
at Bronx Science the topic of Election Day PD came up and I thought
that it would be nice to get the Bronx Science and Stuy teachers
together. After thinking about it more, I recalled that there were few
good PD opportunities for CS teachers who taught advanced classes as
opposed to all the CS PD floating around these days at more of a
beginner level.
</p>

<p>
I thought that we could change this. In the end, I hosted PD today and
had teachers from Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, and the
Manhattan Hunter Science High School in attendance. I invited teachers
from a few more schools but in the end we had those four schools and
seventeen teachers.
</p>

<p>
The original agenda was:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>09:00 - 10:00 : Each school describes it's program and courses</li>
<li>10:00 - 11:00 : An intro to Git and GitHub for the classroom</li>
<li>10:00 - 11:45 : Sharing neat lessons</li>
<li>11:45 - 12:00 : Presentation by <a href="http://chicktech.org">ChickTech</a>
</li>
<li>12:00 - 01:00 : Lunch</li>
<li>01:00 - End   : Small group lesson and curriculum work</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oh boy did I mess up on the timing. The description and
discussion of school programs took all morning. It was interesting to
hear how each school's program evolved and how they fit into the
school's culture. Brooklyn Tech, for instance is a school where
students declare majors. This has a big impact on what classes kids
have to take and are able to take. This is very different from Stuy or
Science where kids programs are more open ended or MHSHS which is a
much smaller school and has restrictions related to size. It was also
interesting to note Brooklyn Tech's decision to have every student
take APCS-P. Interesting because Brooklyn Tech is one of the country's
largest high schools and most of them should have done well on the
exam. That gave NYC around 1,400 passing AP scores in one shot. On
the other hand none of the other schools present today offered APCS-P
but did have their own intro CS class that students took prior to
APCS-A.
</p>

<p>
We finished the morning with a visit by Heather from
<a href="http://chicktech.org">ChickTech</a>. ChickTech is a non-profit dedicated to retaining women in
Tech. It works with both girls in K12 and also those in industry. My
hope was to get a conversation started and see if there were some
potential avenues of partnership between the organization and the
schools.
</p>

<p>
After lunch, the group decided that we should do the Git/GitHub
workshop and JonAlf obliged.
</p>

<p>
Overall I think the day was a success. 
</p>

<p>
My hope is that today's attendees can form a core group of CS teachers
who teach more advanced courses and we can form something of a support
group for each other. 
</p>

<p>
I plan to try to facilitate future meetings and hopefully we'll be
able to attract more teachers to our group.
</p>

<p>
All in all I'm very happy with how the day went.
