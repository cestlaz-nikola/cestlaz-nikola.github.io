This week, we're going to look at my setup for Python programming. 
</p>

<p>
I'm an educator, not a professional developer so I'm not working in
huge code bases with dozens or more files at a time. I do periodically
work in medium size code bases and will talk about cross file
navigation and project management later on. There are also more
powerful emacs Python packages. One being <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy">elpy</a>. Elpy looks pretty cool
but for me, it's overkill.
</p>

<p>
Today's about the basics.
</p>

<p>
The first tool I show is <a href="http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/">flycheck</a>. It does code checking on the fly
and supports <a href="http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#flycheck-languages">tons of languages</a>. You might have to install some
external checkers though. For instance, I installed <b><b>pylint</b></b> for
python syntax checking with:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install pylint
</pre></div>

<p>
Cofiguring flycheck is as easy as:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">flycheck</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-flycheck-mode</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>
The video all shows how I like to run Python from within emacs.
</p>

<p>
The other tool I use is <a href="https://github.com/tkf/emacs-jedi">Jedi</a>. It provides more extensive completion
for Python.
</p>

<p>
Here's the setup:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">jedi</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'jedi:setup</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">'python-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">'jedi:ac-setup</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The last hook sets up the autocomplete. 
</p>

<p>
For jedi to work, you'll need to install the jedi server which is done
in emacs by running <b><b>M-x jedi:install-server</b></b>. For that to work,
though, you'll need to have <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">Python Virtualenv</a> istalled. I did that
with:
</p>

<p>
<b><b>EDIT:</b></b> I just got a report that you might need to also install epc (<b><b>sudo pip install epc</b></b>).
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo pip install virtualenv
</pre></div>

<p>
Here's the video:

Earlier today I read <a href="http://www.eliothorowitz.com/blog/2016/07/25/innovate-vs-appropriate/">this post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/eliothorowitz">Eliot Horowitz</a>, founder and CTO of MongoDB.
</p>

<p>
Eliot titled the post "Innovate vs Appropriate" and talks about the
importance of knowing when to come up with something new vs when to
use the accepted tool, technique, or method. Eliot, of course is
discussing this as it applies to MongoDB and it's well worth a read
but it got me thinking about the ever popular need to "disrupt"
education.
</p>

<p>
I've witnessed this disruption or Ed Reform for the last decade
plus. The basic notion that public education isn't working so we need
to disrupt things. We've suffered through:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vouchers</li>
<li>Charters</li>
<li>Online "learning" replacing teachers</li>
<li>Teach for America and other temp type efforts</li>
<li>Merit pay</li>
<li>VAM for teacher evaluation</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>
These disruptions are brought to you by your friendly neighborhood
billionaire "philanthropist" or your politicians.
</p>

<p>
By and large, they haven't worked.
</p>

<p>
Bill Gates got us to close down community schools and create small
ones. While we did need more small schools, overall it didn't work
(<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-epstein/small-schools-miracle-or_b_2641400.html?utm_hp_ref=new-york">link</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A">link</a>). VAM teacher evaluation is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/06/09/how-much-bill-gatess-disappointing-small-schools-effort-really-cost/%0A">arbitrary and capricious</a>,
merit pay has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-why-merit-pay-for-teachers-doesnt-work/2011/03/29/AFn5w9yB_blog.html">never worked</a>, nor does the <a href="http://educationnext.org/online-charters-mostly-dont-work-forum-virtual-schools-greg-richmond/">online thing</a>. Meanwhile, charter
schools by and large <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/32999.htm">don't do better</a> than public schools.
</p>

<p>
Rather than saving our schools, these efforts have lowered teacher
morale and done little for our most vulnerable children.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the difference between ed disruption and the tech world?
Well, for starters, those disrupting education totally ignore the very
advice that Eliot posted about today.
</p>

<p>
Disruption to and of our public schools hasn't been a matter
appropriating what works and innovating what needs to be innovated but rather
a playground for pet projects of politicians and well meaning rich
folk.  Rather than looking at something simple that works, like, say,
smaller class sizes, we get computerized testing. Instead of
experienced teachers, we get inexperienced newbies that leave after
their commitment is up.
</p>

<p>
Why the difference? It hit me while reading Eliot's post. When a
founder is "disrupting" he has skin in the game - it's his company -
sink or swim. Not so for education reformers. Politicians merely need
to be re-elected.Sso as long as something looks good short term, it is
good. Those who disrupt schools are never held accountable. We got
small schools and VAM from among other places, Bill Gates. He admitted
his reforms didn't work but was there any penalty for disrupting so
many lives? Nope. For politicians, it's the same story. As Mayor Mike
Bloomberg once said "If they don't like my education policy, they can
boo me at parades."
</p>

<p>
Can we fix this? Sure, but not unless those forcing the changes have
real skin in the game. Will it happen? I'm not holding my breath.

Happy to be back after a couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
My wife and son spent some time in San Francisco, Mountain View, and
Seattle. The main reason was to see our daughter who's interning out
there for the summer but it was also a great opportunity to catch up
with over 100 former students. If you're interested in seeing more, I
wrote a bit about it <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/end-to-act-1/#.V45OGt9vGAk">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was originally going to start talking about Python development but
then saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/4sp0xs/emacs_org_mode_and_revealjs/">this</a> post on reddit about <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js</a> and using it with
org-mode. Since reveal.js with org-mode  is my goto presentation tool
I thought I'd do a video on that before getting back to "your
regularly schedueld program."
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psDpCpcIVYs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
The main package you have to use for reveal.js presentations in
org-mode is org-reveal. The package to install is <b><b>ox-reveal</b></b>. I also
installed <b><b>htmlize</b></b> for syntax highlighting. Here's the code from
our configuration file:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">ox-reveal</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">ox-reveal</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-reveal-root</span> <span class="s">"http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">org-reveal-mathjax</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">htmlize</span>
<span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The org-reveal-root setq tells your presentation where to find the
reveal.js code. In this example, we're getting from the cloud. You can
also install it locally.
</p>

<p>
The org-reveal-mathjax is just so that LaTeX equations will look nice.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping the video is pretty self-explanitory and the org-reveal
<a href="https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal%0A">home page</a> is pretty thorough but since the documentation is lagging a
bit behind the code and due to some versioning issues, here are a
couple of things to watch out for:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I made a <b><b>samples</b></b> folder where I'll put code for this series that
isn't part of the configurations.</li>
<li>I showed <b><b>:frag (roll-in)</b></b> as an example of revealing list items
one at a time. Those parens are important and are needed but weren't
in earlier versions - this took me far too long to figure out.</li>
<li>If you read the docs you'll see that there are many more transitions
and you can mix and match them on a page.</li>
<li>You might have to upgrade your emacs packages. If you
<b><b>list-packages</b></b>  in eamcs it will tell you if you have packages to
upgrade. You mark them for upgrading by typing <b><b>U</b></b> and then do the
upgrade with <b><b>x</b></b>. If this doesn't work, you can try getting rid fo
the <b><b>elpa</b></b> folder and then re-installing.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://github.com/zamansky/mazelesson">mazelesson</a> sample presentation shows more features, many that we
haven't covered yet. Check it out but remember that it's for an
earlier version of org-reveal.</li>
<li>Github pages and rawgit are cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hope you enjoy this. Please add any reveal.js tips and tricks of your
own.

<p>
If I look at my leaving Stuyvesant and the NYC Department of
Education to join Hunter College as the end of Act I of my teaching
career, then our family's West Coast swing was a nice way to pull
down the curtain.
</p>

<p>
The impetus for the trip was visiting Batya - she's interning at
Facebook this summer and having an absolute blast.
</p>

<p>
The plan was to spend a few days in San Francisco, then a little south
to Mountain View, where Batya was staying, and then fly up to Seattle
for a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
Of course, while out there, why not see if some of the StuyCS family
wanted to get together.
</p>

<p>
I knew I had a lot of former students out on the West Coast but still, I was
overwhelmed and humbled by the number of people who wanted to spend
time and catch up. 
</p>

<p>
We kicked things off at Bloomberg Beta thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy Bahat.</a> Roy was
never actually my student but we've gotten to know each other over the
years and I value him as a friend and advisor. Roy provided the food
and the space and about 60 former students + a few old timers showed.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/bloomberg.jpg" alt="bloomberg.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
A couple of days later, we had a lunch meetup for the Googlers:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/google.jpg" alt="google.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
and a happy hour at Facebook (sorry, no picture). Then in Seattle, a
nice dinner to close things out.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="img/end-act-1/seattle.jpg" alt="seattle.jpg" align="center"></p>
</div>

<p>
Between these events there were some lunches, a barbecue at Batya's
place  and even a drive by visit with a former student at
Microsoft. Overall, it was easily over 100 students over the course of
the week or so we were out there.
</p>

<p>
I've often said that one of the things I'm proudest of is helping to
build the StuyCS family. A community of people spanning decades. Over
the week, we had events mixing students from the mid 90's to
youngsters currently in college and on their internships.
</p>

<p>
Seeing all these people meeting and supporting each other gave me a
"proud pappa" type feeling even though I didn't do any more than set
the stage for them getting together.
</p>

<p>
Over the week, the conversations were also great - not the straight
tech ones, but the ones that really made me proud of the crew. From
Seth talking about how to better get good CS Ed to more kids, to PJ
discussing why he feels it's so important to be an active mentor to
his young programmers and how to get them to be real thinkers, to
Mike, Sam, Kathy, and Leo discussing the disconnect between
privileged families and those struggling to get by. 
</p>

<p>
What more could a teacher want than their former students being both
happy in their lives and careers as well as good people seeking to
make the world better for everyone.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that made me sad about the trip is that with all the
big events, I really didn't get a chance to spend the time I wanted
with everyone. I hope to do better next time.
</p>

<p>
So, I've now been at Hunter for one semester and things will really
ramp up in the Fall. I'm still a proud part of our StuyCS family and if
being a part of pulling it together is the legacy I left, I can live
with that.
</p>

<p>
The trip was a nice symbolic way to lower the curtain on act 1. I'm
counting on the StuyCS family and all the other players to help so
that we can make sure act 2 is a success and we can build something
similar for more young people throughout the city and perhaps the country.

I'll be traveling for the next couple of weeks so I probably won't
have time for another video until mid to late July. I'll probably
write a post about this series and do some regular blogging over that
time but probably no new videos for a couple of weeks.
</p>

<p>
Also, a couple of notes about the series:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Instead of making a separate git branch for each episode, I'm just
adding on to the master branch on GitHub. If you're not familiar
with Git and GitHub don't worry about this. Hardly anyone will
notice a difference.</li>
<li>If this theme doesn't show well on video, please let me know, I'll
change it.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ok, now to this installments video.
</p>

<p>
It talks about using org-mode to store our emacs init file.
</p>

<p>
The first key is that you can put code-blocks in org-mode:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(emacs-lisp code goes here)
(more emacs lisp goes here)
(and you can have even more here)
#+END_SRC
</pre></div>

<p>
Since it's elisp you can run the individual line using the usual <b><b>C-x C-e</b></b>
but you can run the entire block by placing your cursor anywhere in
the block and typing <b><b>C-c C-c</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
One minor annoyance about editing code blocks is that it doesn't do
syntax highlighting or auto indentation. To solve this, emacs lets you
pull up an editing buffer by typing <b><b>C-c '</b></b>. 
</p>

<p>
You're supposed to be able to save your changes with <b><b>C-c '</b></b> again
or <b><b>C-x C-s</b></b> and kill the buffer without saving changes with <b><b>C-x
C-k</b></b> 
but the version of org-mode that came with my version of emacs
didn't support it - I had to install a newer version of org-mode from
melpa. 
</p>

<p>
I couldn't figure out how to do this via use-package, but if this
problem happens to you, you can just type <b><b>Alt-x package-install</b></b>
and then type <b><b>org</b></b> and hit enter to install it.
</p>

<p>
Once you do that, you might have to reload emacs but then everything
should work. 
</p>

<p>
This lets us move most of our configuration to a separate file. We're
calling it <b><b>myinit.org</b></b> and storing it in our .emacs.d
directory. You can use any name <b><b>except</b></b> init.org as I mentioned in
the video.
</p>

<p>
The file's a little big so here's a link to it:
<a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org">https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs/blob/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Notice how GitHub formats it to look all nice.
</p>

<p>
Here's the raw file so you can see the gory details:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zamansky/using-emacs/master/myinit.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Since we're loading the file in overview mode, when we load it in
emacs we see:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">interface</span> <span class="nv">tweaks</span>

<span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">Autocomplete</span>
<span class="nv">*</span> <span class="nv">Themes</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We can tab open and close each section and add text to clarify things
around the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
All that's left in <b><b>init.el</b></b> is:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">require</span> <span class="ss">'package</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">setq</span> <span class="nv">package-enable-at-startup</span> <span class="nv">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">add-to-list</span> <span class="ss">'package-archives</span>
	     <span class="o">'</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"melpa"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s">"https://melpa.org/packages/"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-initialize</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">;; Bootstrap `use-package'</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">unless</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-installed-p</span> <span class="ss">'use-package</span><span class="p">)</span>

	<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">package-install</span> <span class="ss">'use-package</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">org-babel-load-file</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">expand-file-name</span> <span class="s">"~/.emacs.d/myinit.org"</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
With the last line performing the magic of loading our org file and
running all the code blocks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we added a couple of small interface changes:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">fset</span> <span class="ss">'yes-or-no-p</span> <span class="ss">'y-or-n-p</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-set-key</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">kbd</span> <span class="s">"&lt;f5&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">'revert-buffer</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
The first line lets us type y or n instead of yes or no and the second
let's us reload a file into our current buffer using the <b><b>f5</b></b> key.
</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy this video and find it useful:

    <p>
Yesterday I read over Hillary's briefing on her initiative on
<a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/">Technology and Innovation</a>.
</p>

<p>
A lot of it sounds good but, at least for the education piece, I have
my doubts. My feeling is that she's pretty much aligned with the
current administration education wise and the current administration
has been as bad if not worse than the previous with respect to public
education.
</p>

<p>
While I have issues with some of the education pieces and very much
like some of the others, I don't want to get into that today. I want
to focus on one specific part of her plan. The part that defers
college debt for up to 3 years for founders and entrepreneurs. This
sounds great but is this really a good thing?
</p>

<p>
Some initial responses from the education community is "what about
young teachers, don't they deserve some help on college debt? What
about nurses?…" and of course they're right. On the other hand, I
don't want people to go into teaching for 2 or 3 years just to get
some debt relief benefit and then jump ship. That's the Teach for
America model that I feel has become so harmful.
</p>

<p>
But again, that's not where I'm going with this.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with "who are these founders?" I don't have any hard data
but I have read a couple of recent pieces that indicate that founders
right out of college are typically from well to do backgrounds. This
of course makes sense. A kid up to his or her eyes in debt from a poor
background. No savings, no property, likely a family, that is siblings
and parents who are also treading water can ill afford to take a big
financial risk. A kid from a monied family? Much more so. 
</p>

<p>
This alone makes Hillary's plan a boon for the wealthy but not so
much for the people we need to give a hand up.
</p>

<p>
Next, this plan talks about the founders and only says it will
"explore similar incentives"  for early employees, citing "10 to 20."
This doesn't seem right to me.
</p>

<p>
Now let's look further into the benefits. I don't know what the
success and failure rates are for startups. I've seen a bunch of
figures including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>90% of startups fail within the first three years</li>
<li>Three out of four startups fail</li>
<li>Of 10 startups, 3 or 4 totally fail, 3 or 4 break even and the
others turn a profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't know where the truth lies but I'd imagine that the success
rate for startup by a recent college graduate, wet behind the ears is
probably higher than for a more season professionals.
</p>

<p>
Hillary's plan defers debt for up to three years. If any of the
failure numbers cited above are near correct it means that these kids
will have burned through up to three years with the experience of a
failed startup to show for it.
</p>

<p>
I've always advised my students, all things being equal, start at a
big or mid size company, develop your chops, learn how they do it,
further build out your network, and then go out and do your
thing. Most kids are better served not going directly from college to
their first startup.
</p>

<p>
So there it is. A plan that makes for great "press release" but is it
really addressing the issues?

Yesterday over at <a href="http://avc.com">AVC</a> Fred blogged about the AFSE graduation and
posted a <a href="http://avc.com/2016/06/afse-commencement-speech/">transcript of the speech he gave</a>. It's well worth a read.
</p>

<p>
Some of the comments touched on mentors and role models so I though
I'd talk a little about that here.
</p>

<p>
I've always believed that as a parent, modeling - that is, how we
behave is one of the largest shapers of our kids. It's one thing to
take your kid to a museum because that's what you should do as a good
parent and another if you think - "I wants to go to that museum and
damn it, I'm taking you along." I'm no psychologist but my gut tells
me the former is good but the latter is better. 
</p>

<p>
This of course extends to schools. As teachers we deliver instruction
but we also communicate through how we behave. Students are very
perceptive and we can have influences that we don't even know. I
remember a parent who thanked me because their child started
exercising and being more active because of me. It's not something I
ever talked to the kid about but I would run after my classes at Stuy,
ride to school and in class I might give an exercise anecdote or
two. Just by doing something healthy and positive where kids can see
it led to some good.
</p>

<p>
Now, as teachers, we have limited reach and just as in many cases
where a child won't listen to a parent and needs a friendly teacher to
weigh in, there are plenty of times a student won't really listen to a
teacher, particularly in CS. Most CS teachers don't have extensive CS
backgrounds and self taught kids frequently feel they know more. Even
when a student believes that a CS teacher's got the goods, they're
skeptical - teaching as a profession has been so beaten up many
students will have a ""so why are you teaching and not working at
Google" attitude.
</p>

<p>
Even with the best intentions from parents and teachers, for many students,
particularly those from poor backgrounds there are limits to our
influence. If a parent has to work multiple jobs at crazy hours, they
have less time to be a positive role model. If they've never been to
college or worked in a white collar profession they won't have the
connections and resources to effectively guide their child through the
education to profession maze.
</p>

<p>
This is where mentors and role models become so important.
</p>

<p>
For me, I first saw this when I was a young teacher. My graduates
hadn't gotten to the real world yet and I hadn't developed a
reputation. I'd have friends come in to give tech and industry
talks. What I found was that in addition to being inspirational, it
help authenticate me as being legit. When they would talk about a best
practice that I had already taught them, the classes got the idea that
maybe I did know a thing or two about this CS stuff.
</p>

<p>
You could see the impact when we held <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2012-03-31-checking-in-with-family.html/#.V3Qkkx9vGAk">"Tech speed dating" events</a> where
I mixed current high school students with professionals.
</p>

<p>
So many comments afterwards like "I didn' know I could do that in CS,"
"now I know what I want to do…." Slam dunk!!
</p>

<p>
Of course, you have to curate your volunteers. While a guest talk from
a very senior, very established adult can be inspiring some times,
they can be so far removed from the kids next steps, it can actually
be intimidating and a turn off. As a side note, I don't think that
this would be the case at all with respect to Fred's graduation
speech. His overall sincerity and the fact that he's so connected to
the school and known to the kids made sure of that.
</p>

<p>
When I made my first Hunter college event, I wanted to kick start and
excite the current students and also give myself some CS street cred so
I carefully selected the participants for our first panel / mixer. I
had:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A young VC</li>
<li>A mid 30s CTO of a mid size company</li>
<li>A mid 30s Facebook engineer who also spent time at Google</li>
<li>Assorted recent college grad tech people from big companies, start ups,
and everything in between.</li>
<li>I tried to have a diverse crowd.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wanted a couple of more senior people to show the end of the road
but I wanted most of the people there to be at "the next rung in the
ladder." All indications were that the event was also a slam dunk.
</p>

<p>
Through all of this it's become pretty apparent to me that bringing in
adult mentors and role models can be even more important than covering
every little bit of whatever curriculum you're teaching.  Some people
say that we need more female High School CS teachers and while I agree
with that sentiment, I'd rather have the best CS teacher I can get
regardless of background as long as I have amazing women in tech to
provide for my students as role models. 
</p>

<p>
This led me to think about a couple of the CS Ed programs that I
support. TEALS and ScriptEd. I like both, but they're different
models. In TEALS the volunteer works with the teacher. In ScriptEd,
the volunteer is the teacher. I have many former students that have
volunteered through TEALS but I don't know any who've done SciptEd so
I don't have the same "inside" info. 
</p>

<p>
For TEALS, those volunteers are also role models. Every day that Etsy
engineer is in the classroom those students see and hear from a tech
professional. What's more, they see and hear from one who's taking the
time to be with them.
</p>

<p>
Of course the same is true for ScriptEd but I wonder if after some
time the students view the ScriptEd volunteer as the teacher rather
than the tech professional.
</p>

<p>
There's probably some interesting research in there.
</p>

<p>
Finally nothing is better than really being able to hook kids up with
long term mentors. This is something that I think AFSE's been able to
do but it's an expensive proposition. It's something I'd love to see
more of at schools and as part of the basic budget but with all the
money wasted on things like standardized testing and flawed teacher
evaluation systems, I don't see it coming any time soon.

Now that we have a nice basic configuration, let's make Emacs look a
little nicer.
</p>

<p>
Like most editors, Emacs can be extensively themed. 
</p>

<p>
As shown in the video, you can quickly see the built in themes using
the <b><b>customize-themes</b></b> command.
</p>

<p>
You can load one of these themes by using the <b><b>load-theme</b></b> command
interactively or, more likely by putting:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">'leuven</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
in your init.el. The above code loads the built in <b><b>leuven</b></b> theme.
</p>

<p>
I prefer the <b><b>zenburn</b></b> theme. For that, you have to load the zenburn
package. Here's the code in our init.el:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">zenburn-theme</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">load-theme</span> <span class="ss">'zenburn</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
In the video, I also mention the color theme package.
</p>

<p>
So, customize away.
</p>

<p>
In the links, you'll find some links to some Emacs theme gallery sites
to help find something you like.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for reading and watching and as always, please leave comments,
suggestions and favorite themes.

Out of the box, Emacs supports various types of completion.
</p>

<p>
Tab completion for filenames and commands basically work right out of
the box and Emacs has built in modes like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AbbrevMode">Abbrev</a>, <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HippieExpand">Hippie Expand</a>, and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dynamic-Abbrevs.html">Dabbrev</a> provide a manner of completion for in buffer text.
</p>

<p>
I briefly show Dabbrev (Dynamic Abbrevs) in the video and if you're
interested in the others, follow the links.
</p>

<p>
We saw ow the built in Ido mode and third party packages like Ivy,
which I prefer, and Helm make for better completions on functions,
filenames, and the like and Emacs also has third party packages for in
buffer completion. 
</p>

<p>
The two main contenders are <a href="https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete">auto-complete Mode</a> and <a href="http://company-mode.github.io/%0A">company Mode</a>. I use
auto-complete, others swear by company. The video shows the basics of
auto-complete mode but check both out and decide for yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you feel strongly about one or the other, please share in the
comments.
</p>


<p>
Here's a basic configuration:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">auto-complete</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:init</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">progn</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">ac-config-default</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">global-auto-complete-mode</span> <span class="nv">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
We'll modify this as move along in the series.

Here's a really cool navigation method that I've been meaning to use
more. Avy is a replacement for ace-jump mode which is an
implementation of easymotion, a vim plugin.
</p>

<p>
It's pretty cool and lets you quickly navigate to any spot on the
screen.
</p>

<p>
After triggering avy, or more specifically the <b><b>avy-goto-char</b></b>
function, emacs prompts you for a single character. When you type it,
all instances of the character that start out words change to a
highlighted letter. Type the highlighted letter and you jump to that
location.
</p>

<p>
The avy package comes with a bunch of options including a 2 character
search variant, a timed variant which drops into search, and more.
</p>

<p>
The Avy home page has all the details.

<p>
Here's the configuration I'm using:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">avy</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:bind</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"M-s"</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="nv">avy-goto-char</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
You can check the <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/avy">avy home page</a> for their recommended configuration
which you get by configuring this way instead:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">use-package</span> <span class="nv">avy</span>
  <span class="nv">:ensure</span> <span class="nv">t</span>
  <span class="nv">:config</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">avy-setup-default</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
