Just a brief note to clarify a couple of things. As indicated in the
comments, this post isn't  about what's appropriate for HS CS. It's
more about what kids have after they finish their education - be it
high school, college, code school, or other. 
</p>

<p>
Some of my thoughts are the results of pondering on the exacerbations
of friends after interviewing people for entry level positions.
</p>

<p>
The two examples are just to illustrate the point.

I enjoy reading blogs. It's one of the ways I keep current. Not only
in terms of what's going on in CS Education, but also trends in CS -
academic or professional as well as on a range of other topics.
</p>

<p>
One of the blogs I enjoy is authored by <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">Julia Evans</a>. I don't know
Julia, but we do have some mutual friends. I've enjoyed her <a href="http://jvns.ca">blog</a>. She
does a nice job talking about any number of systems related
issue. I've tried to leave comments a few times but for some reason,
my comments always end up deleted or otherwise not showing up.
</p>

<p>
One recent post, one on <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/03/29/thread-pools-part-ii-i-love-blocking/">concurrency</a> got me thinking. Since the comment
I left there didn't take, I thought I'd write about it here.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice post but the thing that caught my eye was when Julia
said that she " didn't know what a semaphore was until I read this
code and I was like OH THIS IS AMAZING AND SO USEFUL AND WOW." I was a
little surprised, semaphores seem to be one of those basic concepts
that you just know but that is, of course incorrect. I first learned
about semaphores in my honors Systems class with my mentor, the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dewar">Robert Dewar</a>. We started from test and set and worked our way up. I
had two other undergraduate classes that at least mentioned the topic.
</p>

<p>
Then again, I knew that many undergrads would never get a good
treatment of concurrency so I tried to build a bit in to the System
Level Programming  course I designed while at Stuy.
</p>

<p>
This got me thinking - according to her linked in, Julia was a CS
major at McGill - a university that I hold in high regard but either
semaphores were never covered or their treatment didn't make enough of
an impact to be worth remembering. What topics do we cover in our
classes that kids just let fall to the wayside and what topics do we
end up losing as curricula change and we don't have an eye on the big
picture.
</p>

<p>
One big one is memory management. When APCS and college 101 classes
went to Java, memory management went out the window. Not a problem, as
long as memory issues are covered in some other course. Unfortunately
the don't seem to be. You can make a case that kids don't need to
understand memory management or anything about garbage collection but
I'd argue that while one might never have to do their own memory
management a good CS person should have some understanding of what's
going on under the hood or as my friend Gerry says "never use a
technology you couldn't write yourself."
</p>

<p>
Another biggie that I lived through was the IBM PC era. Prior to the
mid to late 80's when the IBM PC ruled the world, kids learned about
CS on timesharing systems. Once the PC took hold, every kid learning
programming or studying CS was working on their own machine. They had
full access to everything and the machine just supported a single
thread. 
</p>

<p>
On the one hand, it was nice since you could easily play with low
level programming and hardware but on the other hand, a hole
generation didn't learn about the complexities of multiple users and
multiple processes. 
</p>

<p>
Early in my career I designed courses and only later did I realize
that you can't just design a course, you have to look at the full arc
of a students education. 
</p>

<p>
I think it's interesting to think about what concepts are getting left
on the side of the road and I wonder if the big players driving CS
education spend any time thinking about this bigger picture.

The difficulties I've had with the city and DOE are pretty well
documented by now.
</p>

<p>
Today I'm going to tell you about my latest dealings with DOE and how
they prevented my team from bringing free quality CS education to city
students. 
</p>


<p>
CSTUY's not running SHIP, its summer program this year.
</p>

<p>
That's not something I'm happy about but part of me knew it might
happen. What did surprise me, although it shouldn't have, was the role that
the NYC DOE played in preventing it from happening.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line initial reason for us not running SHIP this summer
was my time. Moving over to my new position at Hunter has
been terrific but I haven't had the time needed for adequate
fundraising and outreach.
</p>

<p>
I recently talked a bit about the difficulties we've had with
fundraising as compared to the "chosen programs" in 
<a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/2016-04-10-thought-leaders/#.VyKAnh9vH0o">this post</a>.
</p>

<p>
I've also written a bit about related issues in these posts:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul>
<p>
In any event, we weren't going to be able to run this summer.
</p>

<p>
When I spoke to the team, Sam asked, "if we can keep the budget down
and figure out how to not be dependent on fundraising and outreach, can
we do something?" I told him, I'd love to.
</p>

<p>
He came up with a plan. Instead of a full day program, we'd run half
day - this means fewer staff hours and no lunch. If we could run it at
Stuyvesant, in the computer labs (which already run Linux), we
wouldn't have to worry about equipment. 
</p>

<p>
Under this plan, additional fundraising wasn't needed, in fact, kids
could attend free of charge.
</p>

<p>
In terms of outreach, since we already had sufficient funds, even if
we only got returning shipmates and a few from word of mouth we'd be
ok and if we could cast a wider net, so much the better.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and the plan was for me to take the summer off. I'd help with
initial organization but I wouldn't actually work the summer.
</p>

<p>
So, to summarize:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free for the kids</li>
<li>I'm not involved and receive no compensation for the summer (this is
important for later)</li>
<li>My teachers would be paid for teaching in the program and CSTUY
would supply the funds to pay them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We floated the idea to Stuyvesant's principal figuring that since
the teaching staff is from there and some of the kids tat would
benefit are Stuy students it wouldn't be a problem. She said she loved
the idea but had to send it off to the conflict of interests people.
</p>

<p>
You see, it's very important that teachers and former teachers don't
actually benefit from working extra – it's critical that teachers be
kept down.
</p>

<p>
Long story short - the teachers could work the program but aren't
allowed to run it. They can come in and teach but can't talk to the
principal about organizing it. For some reason, running a <b><b>free</b></b>
program for kids instead of relaxing over the summer means that the
teachers are getting this <b><b>huge</b></b> benefit. Sure they'd be paid for
their time, but that seems fair. 
</p>

<p>
As to me, I'm not allowed any dealings with the DOE for a year. Forget
the fact that I wanted to set this up while taking <b><b>no</b></b> pay so that
the kids wouldn't be left without a program. Nope, that's no good -
can't have us bringing quality CS education to the kids.
</p>

<p>
I dealt with these folks once before so I wasn't really surprised.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, a friend connected me with people at Amplify
to see about creating their APCS MOOC. We met a couple of times but
then the DOE people said I couldn't work with them even though I was
just going to be working on the MOOC and not dealing directly with the
DOE in any way. I wasn't negotiating contracts, making sales pitches,
or anything. I was just going to work on MOOC content.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't like a certain NYC School's Chancellor who had just left the DOE and
took the leadership position at Amplify. That wasn't a conflict - I
guess it's just important to keep the teachers in line - the rules
aren't meant for the higher ups.
</p>

<p>
Funny side note – when I shared the fact that I couldn't work for
Amplify with my friend, his first reaction was "because of the union?"
That seems to be the knee-jerk reaction from people in the business
world. Nope - the union was fine with it - it was the administration /
city. The city has done <b><b>far</b></b> more harm to the public schools than
the union ever could. Pretty much all the union does is make sure the
city follows the jointly negotiated contract.
</p>

<p>
Back to the story.
</p>

<p>
So, we're not allowed to use school space to bring free CS education
to kids this summer. Plenty of other organizations non-profit and
for-profit alike seem to have no problem bringing their programs into
the schools. I'm sure many are getting money for this, grant based or
otherwise. In all cases, I'd take my team and their program over what
the DOE is actually rolling out.
</p>

<p>
This is the type of thing makes me want to say to hell with DOE but,
unfortunately, they aren't affected, it's the kids that lose out.

There are all sorts of awards for teachers. The Presidential awards,
NEA awards, National and State level awards, and more. There are also
awards and honors given in more narrow areas like NCTM for math and
our own ACM.
</p>

<p>
I've haven't won any and never expected to. I've never played well
with the establishment.
</p>

<p>
It's ok though. For every honoree that I can point to and say "there's
a master teacher," there are half a dozen who you look at just know
that it was more about politics and connections than about teaching
chops.
</p>

<p>
Like anyone else, though, I do like a pat on the back and it is nice
to get some confirmation that you're having a positive effect on kids
lives.
</p>

<p>
So what are my awards? Well, I received what I consider my highest
honor this past weekend. I was in Hot Springs Arkansas for Jen and
Marcel's wedding. 
</p>

<p>
It was a great weekend with old friends and new celerbrating a
wonderful event and I couldn't be happier for the couple.
</p>

<p>
As a teacher, to be included in your former students life events is as
big as it gets. I can't begin to say how honored I was to be included
in their day. Even more special, that Marcel's brother Barnabas and
his wife Suki are my oldest couple - they started dating back in my
class back in the beginning.
</p>

<p>
It's not the first time I've been invited to former students
weddings. I've seen around a dozen or so of my students wed. Every
time it's special, just as it's special when a former student decides
to reach out to let me know how they're doing or to reconnect in
general. When they elect to share part of their lives with me, it
tells me that I was at least a little bit of a force for good way back
when.

A few weeks ago, a friend asked if I knew any CS teachers that were
available to work this summer. At the time, I didn't have anyone to
recommend. We were still up in the air on running CSTUY's SHIP summer
immersion program.
</p>

<p>
We ultimately decided not to run SHIP this summer. Mostly due to the
fact that in my new position, I didn't have the time to do the
necessary fund-raising and outreach. We're continuing with our Saturday
program through mid May and plan to bring more opportunities to the
kids of New York City in the future.
</p>

<p>
That's not what I want to write about today. That summer program
looking for a teacher, let's call it program X made me think about
many of the players driving K12 CS education both in NY and beyond.
</p>

<p>
It turns out, the people that were running program X didn't have a
teacher, didn't have curriculum or program, and in fact didn't have
a plan. What they were able to do, however, was raise money.
</p>

<p>
This is a sore spot with me - for CSTUY, we run program to program and
for me, fund-raising is the hardest part. Here we have a program that
has no idea as to what they're going to do or who's going to do it and
they ended up with substantial capital to work this non-existent
program.
</p>

<p>
It's a sore spot because I've seen it before and seen it over and
over. People with either little or no CS experience, little or no
teaching experience and frequently neither being anointed as thought
leaders in CS Education or at the very least, the people with the "hot
program."
</p>

<p>
I've seen this in companies, non-profits, for-profits, and
government. Some of these groups and programs are now considered
undisputed leaders when, if you dig beneath the hype, they really
don't know what they're doing.
</p>

<p>
Now, there are some "thought leaders" who have been in the trenches
and know their stuff but they seem few and far between. 
</p>

<p>
I know that all of these people running these programs and being given
this platform to influence our young are well meaning and I welcome
everybody to the table but maybe, just maybe they should take a step
back and ask themselves - do they really know what they're doing or
are the just experimenting with other peoples children.

Switched over from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> yesterday.
</p>

<p>
One of the primary reasons was that I got fed up with managing a Ruby
development environment across all my machines. In spite of my
rantings, I'm sure Ruby and Ruby installs are fine - it's just
something that I'd have to deal with on a recurring basis for one
specific task - other than for Jekyll blogging, I don't use Ruby.
</p>

<p>
So while a platform based on Python - generally my go to language,
made sense, the other driving force for the switch was the fact that
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> and <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a> have become such major parts of my workflow and
productivity.
</p>

<p>
What do I use org-mode for?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lesson planning</li>
<li>document preparation (instead of LaTeX)</li>
<li>note taking</li>
<li>blogging</li>
<li>email (with mu4e)</li>
<li>managing my schedule</li>
<li>tracking bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<p>
and probably a lot more.
</p>

<p>
Jekyll is actually a really nice tool. It's simple. You put together a
simple directory structure: Templates in _layouts, blog posts in
_posts, drafts in _drafts. Other directories that start with an
underscore are ignored and everything else is copied up to your site.
</p>

<p>
I love that it's "close to the metal" You can put in html files with
some meta information up top or markdown. 
</p>

<p>
You can take a look at my old site at
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io-jekyll</a> if you want to
take a look.
</p>

<p>
The beauty is that you just push your files up to GitHub and it
automatically runs Jekyll and builds your site (<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/">more info here</a>).
</p>

<p>
The problem is that Jekyll doesn't play well with org-mode and
org-markup so my workflow became something like this
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a post <b><b>something.org</b></b> in the _org directory.</li>
<li>From within emacs, publish it. I've configured org-mode to publish
by exporting the org-mode markup file to html and saving it in the
_drafts directory.</li>
<li>If it looks good, copy and rename the file from _drafts to the
_posts directory and push it up to GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p>
A little clunky, but it works. The bigger problem was the amount of
time I'd spend putting html blocks into my org formatted posts to get
them to look the way I wanted (or at least close enough).
</p>

<p>
Enter Nikola.
</p>

<p>
Nikola's a much more powerful tool. It does much more but as a result
is much more complex. Normally, that's not my style but in this case
since It's Python, things balance out.
</p>

<p>
I still have to figure out the entire templating system and all the
plugins but getting started was pretty quick.
</p>

<p>
The big win is that Nikola supports a ton of formats for your posts
and pages. Native org-mode support for me was what did it for me. On top of
that, although I haven't tested it yet, is that there's also an
org-mode plugin to export to Nikola restructure text.
</p>

<p>
My new workflow:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write the post as an org-mode file.</li>
<li>run <b><b>nikola github_deploy</b></b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that's it. You can look at my Nikola site here:
<a href="https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io">https://github.com/cestlaz/cestlaz.github.io</a>.
The source code is in the <b><b>src</b></b> branch, the actual rendered blog in
the <b><b>master</b></b> branch.
</p>

<p>
So far, I'm pretty happy with the setup.

		I think I've got the move worked out but if you're reading this via an
		rss or atom reader, make sure to check back in a couple of days - you
		might have to re-subscribe.
</p>

<p>
		Why am I switching?
</p>

<p>
		Because I hate Ruby. 
</p>

<p>
		Ok, not really - I barely know the language. I was already a  Python
		guy when Ruby came along and I didn't see any real added value to
		switching. 
</p>

<p>
		This isn't really about Ruby though, it's really about how that which
		we don't know is strange and frightening. In this case, the ruby ecosystem.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LV0wTtiJygY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
		I started using Jekyll because that's what was supported by GitHub
		pages. It's fairly simple and it basically worked. It had a few
		warts, specifically, I've had problems getting org-mode blog posts to
		publish just the way I'd like and it's hard to debug when a post has
		some bad markup in it, but it got the job done. 
</p>

<p>
		Recently, though, I've had to re-install Jekyll a number of  times and
		for me, that's been a nightmare.
</p>

<p>
		One is supposed to just be able to <b><b>sudo gem install jekyll</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
		Ok, so you need some packages installed:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
		But I've got ruby 1.9 and I need ruby 2 point something. Ok:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt-get install ruby2.0 ruby2.0-dev
</pre></div>

<p>
		But that fails since we're still running 1.9. Every time I look for a
		solution I go down the ruby ecosystem rabbit hole. 
</p>

<p>
		All I want is Jekyll!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		Why can't I just <b><b>pip install jekyll</b></b> like I can do with Python
		packages!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		In truth, there's nothing wrong with the ruby ecosystem, It's just
		something I'm not familiar with. I probably had to go through the same
		battles with Python it's just that I did them incrementally over time.
</p>

<p>
		The truth is, setting up a development environment should be much
		easier. It used to be that I installed Linux, it had C installed and I
		just had to install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>. Now it's all about tool chains, virtual
		environments, containers, and more.
</p>

<p>
		I think this is what <a href="https://twitter.com/roybahat">Roy</a> was talking about when we traded
		tweets on using development environments in an  <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/2016/04/12/ide-or-cloud.html#.Vw_nPN9vETt">Ide or in the cloud</a>.
</p>

<p>
		If it's hard for me to get an environment running, imagine some poor
		soul who just went through a "learn to code" web site and now has to
		figure out how to set up his or her own machine!!!!!!
</p>

<p>
		I don't have a solution but at least it hasn't stopped me and others
		from trying new things.
</p>

<p>
		Two of my CS blogging friends, <a href="https://gflint.wordpress.com/">Garth Flint</a> and <a href="http://blog.acthompson.net/">Alfred Thompson</a> have in
		their own ways talked about this same issue. Garth, showing a bias
		towards VB yet still working to get his head around Python. Alfred
		shows the same disdain for Linux and the command line as I show
		towards Windows. All this leads to valuable learning experiences and
		discussions.
</p>

<p>
		Personally, I'm also going through this battle as I continue to
		explore Clojure.
</p>

<p>
		So, I'm going to finish the changeover to Nikola in the next day or
		two. Remember to check back in case the feeds aren't working.
</p>

<p>
		Once I make the change, I'll talk about Jekyll vs Nikola as actual
		blogging platforms.

Another friend had just asked me about IDEs vs local installs for learning enviromnents the day before.
</p>

<p>
So, should we use cloud based IDEs when teaching CS or should we use
local installs.
</p>

<p>
There isn't a single right answer but I thought I'd share some of my thoughts here.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping this is helpful to both those of us in the trenches as well
as maybe some platform developers out there.
</p>

<p>
Some times, you don't have a choice.
</p>

<p>
On the web based side, does your school have the bandwidth. We're not
only talking about the pipe to the outside world but also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/nyregion/bronx-science-bans-cellphones-from-wi-fi-as-students-devour-it.html?_r=0">wifi within
the school</a>.  If kids can't reliably get to the web based environment,
it's not a viable option. On the other hand, cloud based software will
always be up to date and properly configured and kids can use them
from home or pretty much anywhere they have a connection.
</p>

<p>
On the other side we have local installs. This can also present
problems. Is the teacher allowed to install locally? Does he or she
know how to do it? Who's going keep all the machines up to date and configured? 
</p>

<p>
Assuming we can get past the technical issues we can start looking at
the education side of thing.
</p>

<p>
On the web based side, you've got a silo. This can be both good and
bad. In an intro class, using a tool like <a href="http://codesters.com">Codesters</a> can keep the cost
of entry low, allow students to share work online and allow teachers
to make use of their curricular materials. If you can't tell, I'm a
big fan of Codesters and the Codesters team. The limitation is that
you have to use their simplified interface and toolset.
</p>

<p>
Some web based IDEs like <a href="http://koding.com">Koding</a> offer more flexibility - one tool with
many languages as well as deployment. The cost is complexity. With
Koding, you're basically running a virtual machine in the
cloud. You've got their web based IDE and a terminal shell so it's not
as complex as doign everything from scratch locally but it's not as
structured as Codesters and is more of a general purpose site rather
than one focussed soley on learning.
</p>

<p>
Then you have <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>. This looks to be a great platform for
experienced programmers to play with and explore new languages but I'd
be concerned about using it with beginners. It looks like they're
rolling out some teacher tools so this might be worth revisiting soon.
</p>

<p>
In any case and with other web based products, you're living in the
providers silo. 
</p>

<p>
Personally, I'm a command line wonk and confessed Emacs geek so I'm
generally wary of an online environment without an exit strategy to
real world tools. Eventually, if all development moves into the
browser as platform then this problem goes away, but for now, you're
not going to have the expressive power and flexibility that a local
install gives.
</p>

<p>
Local installs let you use more powerful and flexible tools either
alone or in combination.
</p>

<p>
Keeping kids out of silos also makes it easier for them to learn new
tools, languages, and techniques.
</p>

<p>
Since I like generic tools, I'm not a fan of big professional IDEs
like Eclipse. I'm an Emacs geek but Atom, Sublime Text, and Vim are
all good as well.
</p>

<p>
There are also an assortment of beginner IDEs like Dr. Racket and I'm
a fan with these for beginners as long as there's an exit strategy.
</p>

<p>
For completeness, I should mention that if I weren't an old school
Emacs guy, I might check out something like JetBrain's IDEs. They're
much lighter weight than something like Eclipse but still full
featured. Somewhere between a true general purpose, customizable,
programmable editor and an all encompassing IDE.
</p>


<p>
In general, I use online enviromnents with my classes early on when:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They're pretty much identical or equivalent to the installed version.</li>
<li>They provide some value added (<a href="http://codingbat.com">codingbat</a> for example) so they're not
being used as a development environment but for some other purpose.</li>
<li>They help with student collaboration (such as cloud9 or Koding.com
for more advanced kids).</li>
</ul>
<p>
In any case, it's imporant that our kids aren't locked into any IDE be
it web based or local.
</p>

<p>
Our kids that go on to more advanced CS studies will certainly need to
break out of sheltered world of a learning IDE and we're not doing
them a service if we shelter them too long. 
</p>

<p>
Our other kids also benefit from seeing beyond these restrictive
environments. A student might learn to code in Python in one of our
classes, but if we do our jobs right, that student might be writing a
little Javascript to automate Google Docs.
</p>

<p>
I can't tell you how many people I've seen go through online coding
courses in a web based enviromnent only to be unable to do anything
outside of that enviromnent.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, we want our kids to be empowered to grow on
their own. All of the things I've talked about here are merely
tools. Each has it's place. It's up to the teacher to make the roadmap
and to lead the student down the path.

<p>
It's been a while since my last post and a while since I started at
Hunter.
</p>

<p>
Time to share a bit about what I've been up to.
</p>

<p>
One of the better kept secrets in New York City is Hunter College's
computer science program. It's been around for years and it's been
that way for years. In fact, when I was looking to get my masters
degree back in the mid nineties I carefully researched all of the
area's MS in CS programs. It came down to Hunter College and Courant
Institute at NYU. I was going to go with Hunter since the programs
seemed comparable and Hunter was far more affordable but I had to go
with NYU due to class schedules. Too many of the Hunter offerings were
to early in the day and I had my full time teaching job to consider.
</p>

<p>
Hunter isn't currently offering their Masters program but their
Bachelor of Arts program is alive and well, it's just that people
don't know about it.
</p>

<p>
Part of my job is to change that.
</p>

<p>
Well, not really, part of my job is to add my piece to the puzzle. The
rest will take care of itself.
</p>

<p>
My piece? It's all about creating a tech culture, tying into the NY
Tech ecosystem, and filling in the gaps that are shared by just about
every college computer science program.
</p>

<p>
How do we do it? 
</p>

<p>
The long term plan is that we're starting a new CS Honors program. In
the fall, I'll be teaching and mentoring a group of entering
undergrads. We'll have workshops, trips, activities. You name it. I'll
also be teaching them modified versions of our courses with the hope
of bringing some of my modifications back to the rest of the student
body. Things like integrating real tools and professional techniques
into what is already a solid academic program.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, I'm getting to know Hunter's current CS students and
working to energize the existing community. 
</p>

<p>
We already had an amazing event hosted at <a href="http://yext.com">Yext</a>. We had a panel and
mixer with representatives from about a dozen companies talking to the
kids about the possibilities ahead of them.
</p>

<p>
We've also set up a couple of workshops in house.
</p>

<p>
I'm also starting to talk to friends at companies across the city to
plan out both curriculum and programs to set up our kids to
succeed. 
</p>

<p>
My goal is that within five years, I want people to realize that
Hunter CS is the place to be for CS Education in NYC. Not everyone can
afford the 40K and up private college tuition and there's no reason to
when you can get a great CS education with ties to the tech community
at CUNY prices.
</p>

<p>
If you want to help, drop me a note. We're looking to start something
very special and you have a chance to be a part of it.

<p>
Having just concluded almost a quarter century at one job in one
place, I've been reflecting on a number of things.
</p>

<p>
What I accomplished, what I've failed to accomplish, highlights,
low lights and everything in between.
</p>

<p>
I've also learned a lot over these twenty five years.
</p>

<p>
One thing I learned is DevOps and System Administration. 
</p>

<p>
Back around 1993 or 1994 Stuy wasn't really on the internet. Yes, we
were able to scam stuy.edu even though we were a high school and yes
we did have a class B address block but no one really had access.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, Bruce, a student of mine at the time and I ended up with the
job of getting Stuy onto the internet. Bruce was one of our superstar
kids and people thought I had extensive experience setting up and
running networks. Truth be told I messed around a bit but there's no
way I would have hired myself for the job.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we were off. 
</p>

<p>
We were able to take one of the RS/6000 AIX workstations that were
supposed to be used as CAD stations and repurposed it as a server. We
made email accounts for everyone and were off.
</p>

<p>
Neither Bruce nor I really knew what we were doing but we figured
things out. I learned a lot from him and I'd like to think he also got
some benefit out of working with me. Fortunately, we seemed to have a
knack for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linux-System-Administration-Handbook-Edition/dp/0131480057/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=61%2B57ajucML&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR117%2C160_&amp;refRID=164V89GZMZM2X9M2S8AH">finding the answers</a>.
</p>


<p>
Of course, we had our moments. Once, we got a critical patch
announcement from IBM. It said that if we needed the patch and didn't
apply it were were in big trouble but if our machine didn't need it,
applying the patch would kill our system. It was unclear whether we
needed the patch or not.
</p>

<p>
After about a half hour research, we determined that we didn't need
the patch.
</p>

<p>
But applied it anyway :-(.
</p>

<p>
D'Oh.
</p>

<p>
After a brief set of panic attacks and a bunch of fumbling around, we
did manage to restore things.
</p>

<p>
So, Bruce and I ran the system for a year or so and as I said, I
learned a lot. Now, Bruce was close to graduating so I was starting to
worry that I'd have to figure this all out myself soon. That was a
seriously frightening thought. 
</p>

<p>
I figured it would be good to bring in a couple of new super smart
students. As it turns out, Jon was one of them. 
</p>

<p>
At one point, there was some problem and Bruce and I were going to
head to the office to try to figure it out. Jon asked if he could come
and watch. I thought that was a great idea so I agreed.
</p>

<p>
We all went to the office and Bruce and I went to work. After about
fifteen minutes, Jon blurted out:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

We all cracked up.
</p>

<p>
He was absolutely right. We had no clue. We didn't know what we were
doing but we had become pretty good at figuring things out.
</p>

<p>
Truth be told, that really is the norm. If you already knew how to
solve the problem, well, then it really wouldn't have been a problem
to begin with.
</p>

<p>
So, you learn to figure it out. It's something I learned not to be
afraid of a long time ago. I hope that it's something I've been able
to convey to my students.

SoftDev students are hard at work on their final projects. By now,
they all have fairly complex code bases. This limits how much I can
help them with debugging.
</p>

<p>
There are some problems, though, that they have to contend with that
even with experience, are hard to spot. Notably because the very
tools you use to debug these errors are part of the problem.
</p>

<p>
Last week, this happened twice. Both cases were brought to me by
really strong students which just goes to underscore how insidious
these problems can be.
</p>


<p>
Here's a fake code snippet of a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> application that illustrates
both problems.
</p>


<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span class="linenr"> 1: </span>from flask import Flask, render_template
<span class="linenr"> 2: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 3: </span>app = Flask(__name__)
<span class="linenr"> 4: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 5: </span>@app.route("/")
<span class="linenr"> 6: </span>def index():
<span class="linenr"> 7: </span>    return "hello"
<span class="linenr"> 8: </span>
<span class="linenr"> 9: </span>@app.route('/test/&lt;some_data&gt;')
<span class="linenr">10: </span>def test():
<span class="linenr">11: </span>    picture_url = build_url(some_data)
<span class="linenr">12: </span>    result = api_test(picture_url)
<span class="linenr">13: </span>    do_something(result)
<span class="linenr">14: </span>
<span class="linenr">15: </span>if __name__ == "__main__":
<span class="linenr">16: </span>   app.debug = True
<span class="linenr">17: </span>   app.secret_key = "some secret key"
<span class="linenr">18: </span>   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>


<p>
First, the "easy" one. The student was trying to deploy the
application. We use <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a> to deploy our applications,
ultimately on <a href="http://digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> servers in the cloud. 
</p>

<p>
The student was using the correct command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell">gunicorn -W 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
</pre>
</div>

<p>
but it wasn't working. It ran, but whenever he went to the site, it
came back with an error.
</p>

<p>
The problem?
</p>

<p>
He had to change:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.debug = True
   app.secret_key = "some secret key"
   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
to
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">app.secret_key = "some secret key"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.debug = True
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Normally, when developing and testing our applications, we use the
test server that's bundled with Flask. The line that reads
"app.run…" takes care of this.
</p>

<p>
When running the application as a "main program" - "python app.py" the
if statement is true and it runs the indented lines, setting the
secret key which is required for session management.
</p>

<p>
When running under <b><b>gunicorn</b></b>, the <b><b>gunicorn</b></b> server loads the
application as a module and then runs it. In this case name isn't main
so it never sets secret key and so we have a problem.
</p>

<p>
Pretty subtle and even though we did cover this in class, it comes up
pretty rarely so it's not an easy catch.
</p>

<p>
Then there was this problem.
</p>

<p>
The setup for this one's a little more complicated. The group was
using a facial recognition api. You provide the API with the url to an
image, it fetches it and does recognition.
</p>

<p>
It's also important to note that when Flask is running, it will serve
files from a static directory, so, if I'm running my flask server on
myhost, port 800 and you stored an image named picture.jpg in the
static directory, going to:
</p>

<verbatim>
 http://myhost:8000/static/picture.jpg
</verbatim><br><br><p>
would get that image.
</p>

<p>
The group did things right. They ran the Flask test server to serve
the static files and then wrote a small python program to test the
api:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python">picture_url = build_url(some_data)
result = api_test(picture_url)
do_something(result)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Everything worked fine. 
</p>

<p>
But, when they put this code in as a route in their web app (as in the
top code fragment), it froze. 
</p>

<p>
They couldn't figure it out.
</p>

<p>
The code worked as a "stand alone" but not in the web app.
</p>

<p>
The problem?
</p>

<p>
Once again, the built in Flask development server.
</p>

<p>
The development server runs in a single thread / process. This means
it can only do one thing at a time. When they ran their test as a
separate program, the api they used made a request to their app to
serve up the static picture file and it worked.
</p>

<p>
When they ran from the Flask application itself, their app made a call
to the web api (line 12) and then blocked while waiting for the
response. The web api tried to request the image from the Flask app
but it was blocked – <b><b>deadlock</b></b>.
</p>

<p>
Again, the solution was to run the web app using a server that could
handle multiple requests - gunicorn.
</p>

<p>
Once again, that solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
Both of these problems were fairly subtle and very hard to catch -
even with experience. I remember the hours I lost when I was learning
this stuff.
</p>

<p>
Some times kids get caught up in algorithms or poor code design but
sometimes, it's just the tools.
